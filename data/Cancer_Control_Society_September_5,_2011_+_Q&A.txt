Aajonus – Remedy to Reverse Cancer

Aajonus live, addressing the Cancer Control Society.

Thank you. Now how many of you are biochemists? How many of you understood all of the language that went on here during this entire entire weekend about what nutrients you have to have for your particular condition or whatever? I want you to throw all of that out.

Get rid of all of it; you are just going to be confused. I am a biochemist and a very adept one and I can't even keep up with it.

Know that any time you are taking any kind of medication or supplement, even if they are called natural, how they are made is: the producer, wanting to make a very good product, goes to a laboratory and says 'I want a natural vitamin - all completely natural, all completely natural. I don't want you to use anything unnatural in it. And the laboratory says "Oh, I can do that!"

Do you know how they do that? They go to General Mills, General Foods, Purina and they buy all of their left over food waste. And that is what they take the elements from. It has been subjected to 60,000 chemicals, highly processing and full of toxins.

Then that company will use a natural solvent and that natural solvent is kerosene. And they use kerosene derivatives to extract the nutrients that will be put into your pill. or liquid or whatever it is. How many of you would soak your food in kerosene for 30 minutes, rinse it off for 45 seconds and eat it? That is what you are doing when you are having any supplement.

I gave this particular information to a group and a big famous natural supplemental company. They filed a lawsuit against me. I showed them all of my research with all laboratories and told them about the kerosene and where they got the stuff. And this company said 'No, we provide our own... we grow our food".

I said "But if you grew your food and just used your food, you would still have to use kerosene as the extractor, or a kerosene derivative. Plus you would be charging a thousand dollars a pill."

They have to go get waste product to make it viable, profitably viable. So that company backed off. No one has been able to sue me because what I have to tell you is correct.

If you want good healthy nutrients, the only place you are going to get them is raw food.

Now you have to consider what we are. We are bacteria. You are a half a percent human. For every one human gene, you have 150 bacterial genes. So you have to take everything the pharmaceutical and medical industries say, no matter who it is, whether it is an alternative or what, and you have to question what they say, based on the theory of the bacteria theory of causing disease.

Bacteria does not cause disease. E. Coli 157H7 may because that is a man-made one. The only place I've been able to collect one 157H7 is from laboratories that were given it by the FDA or the CDC. And when I put a fractionating enzyme on that particular bacteria, it does not fractionate as normal bacteria fractionate into 5 parts. It splices. That means it is man-made. Only man-made bacteria are able to be spliced.

All of the nonsense about E. Coli being a problem is all because Monsanto and Dow want your dollar for fertilizers. They tried to outlaw last year manure as as fertilizer because of the E. Coli 157H7 threat. So what would be left if we outlawed natural fertilize? Dow and Monsanto.

So you have to take a hard look at what is going on out there. They are trying to get rid of our farmers. They are trying to get rid of our natural farms. And that is the only way you can get pure whole natural vitamins. Once you heat food above 105 degrees, you have destroyed the bacterial activity. And remember that all functions of any animal are bacterial. If you took an antibiotic for 5 days, you have destroyed one percent of the body's functionality. Think about that. Then you wonder why people who take antibiotics for extended periods get weaker and weaker and weaker and more susceptible. Take my mother for example. She got breast cancer about 9 years ago. She called me and said 'I know you are entirely against this but I am going to do it.' She is a nurse; caught up in the whole thing. I said 'well, what are you going to do?' She said 'first I am going to have the lumpectomy and then I am going to have pinpoint radiation'. I said 'OK, Mom, let's take a look at those. Lumpectomy. They are going to remove what, eleven of your lymph glands? What do lymph glands do in the body? Lymph glands are your immune system. There really is no such thing as an immune system. The pharmaceutical idea of an immune system is just to confuse you. You have a cleansing system in your body. The lymphatic system is responsible for cleaning any waste and toxin out of your body. It has to break down cells and dissolve them into compounds that it can put under the skin so you can perspire them out of the body. 90 percent of toxins are supposed to leave through the skin. 10 percent to the other tracts – digestive, bowels and urinary tract. But 90% are supposed to be through the skin.’

If you have rashes, if you have pimples, if you have cancer, expect it. Be happy you have it, because it is going out through the skin. Imagine the damage you would do to the intestines. and to your digestion, if it were going out the intestinal tract. You have to think about all of those things. When you reach 112 degrees, you have incapacitated all enzymes that help digestion. When you reach 122 degrees, you've destroyed most of your major vitamin, including vitamin A. By the time you hit 132 degrees, you have destroyed all of those natural vitamins vitamins, enzymes and all those sub category

nutrients. When you get up to 141 degrees, which was the old pasteurization temperature - and for only 15 seconds - you've cauterized 50% of your calcium. That means you are unable to utilize 50% of your calcium. Now, the higher the temperature goes, you reach all kinds of points of destruction - protein destruction, fat destruction that causes lipid peroxides, heterocyclic amines and all sorts of compounds. There are 32 known toxins produced from cooking. All of those cause build-up of toxins in the body. When you reach the point of cancer like I had, you are in really bad shape and I was 20 years old.

My death sentence was [at age] 21. I first got an ulcer. The treatment for that gave me a tumor on the ulcer. The treatment for that was a vagotomy pyloroplasty. They removed the tumor, sewed up and stretched my duodenum into 3 times the normal size, completely starving it and severing all the vagus nerves to my stomach so I would no longer secrete hydrochloric acid. If I had no hydrochloric acid, I couldn't have an ulcer, right? But how about protein digestion? They put me in the category of the octogenarians who can not produce hydrochloric acid digest their proteins.

So, basically, how was I to live? They also told me, because I did not produce hydrochloric acid that I would be in danger of death if I ate anything raw. I had to steam apples, bananas, no matter what it was , everything had to be cooked. You take a look at that. If that destroys all the nutrients, then how am I going to benefit? I did what they said. I ended up a worm on the floor. I was so painful on my back because the radiation was so intense, they cauterized 5 inches of my back. It was solid. If I made even a bit of movement, I was in excruciating pain. I lived on a floor, crawling on the floor like a worm. ... so much pain I couldn't urinate into a vessel, I couldn't defecate into a vessel. I vomited, urinated, defecated all over myself and just traveled around the wooden floor of the living room - dining room combined, just doing that.

And then a couple of volunteers from a hospice came to help me several days a week and they would clean me up and the whole house. One of them was an 18 year old African American boy from Watts. He said "if you drink carrot juice and raw milk, you probably will reverse your cancers". I lived on powdered doughnuts and RC Cola. What's this about carrot juice and raw milk? At that point - after the radiation therapy within a few weeks, 6 or 7 weeks,- all the bone deteriorated around my gum, because why? I had damaged the blood and bones so that I developed multiple myeloma - cancer of the blood and bone - and then developed lymphoma from the chemotherapy. So, their therapies give you cancer. Nowadays, they make about $289,000 per cancer patient. That is a lot of money. Back then, they got $160,000 for me. They were still doing very well. They do not want a cure for cancer. And a cure for cancer, as Dr. Samuel Epstein who was a doctor for several presidents, said "The only cure for cancer is diet. All of the medical profession's treatments for cancer are only harmful and will not get you well and will promote more cancer."

Now let's take a look at what cancer is, from my perspective. When I did autopsies and did my research, what I found was mainly 98% of a tumor was always dead cells. Dead cells the body couldn't clean, dissolve and eliminate from the body. Why? Because the lymph system didn't move.

Now how did we go from - 6 years ago, one cancer in a thousand - to one cancer in 2 if you are a male and 1 in 3 of you are a female - according to Dr. Samuel Epstein? How did we go from that? We went from that because we went to trans-fatty acids. Trans fatty-acids are vegetable oils or mineral oils or petroleum oils that are hydrogenated. When you hydrogenate an oil, you turn it into plastic. That is how plastic is made. So you are eating plastic fats. Now, what do these plastic fats do? They dehydrate and solidify in the body. ... mostly in the lymphatic system because the lymphatic system bases 60 to 80 % of its work on fats. So you have this waxy hard fat in your lymphatic system. You are not going to clean the body. You are not going to take those dead cells and dissolve them. So the body is going to start building them in little fibroids all over the system.

If you are a lucky female, you've got all that tissue down there to build it. That is why women live longer; they have a repository down there and can get rid of a lot of the tumors with dead cells without forming into tumors that will block the functionality elsewhere such as the heart, lungs or liver. Dissolving the dead cells is the main focus of cancer. How do you dissolve dead cells? I found it very easy. Now I am a 44 year cancer survivor. As of December, I was supposed to die in December of 1968. And here I am today almost 65, speaking to you today.

I don't cure anybody; food does. And when people go on my diet, they have a 95 percent success rate. Not only cancer but everything else. The esteemed Dr. Nora Van Winkle, who is the chief neuroscientist at Columbia University in New York City challenged me, so I gave her - this was in 2002 - she challenged me about that record and then I gave her the 242 cancer patients that I had worked with up to that time that had been on the diet for at least 6 years. She called every one of them and found that 96% of them were still alive and well. And still doing the diet about 90%.

The ones that passed away, guess how much of the diet they did. 40 to 50 %. The ones who died, they were very thin people. I t ell everybody in my books "Get Fat". Fats are what dissolve toxins in the body. Your body gets the best energy from fats, it will dissolve toxins from fats and it will protect and strengthen the body. So, fats are the most important. Now you can say "Aajonus, you don't look so fat", right? That is because I have been eating nothing but raw since February of 1972. And when you research and look at fats under an electronic microscope, especially after they are broken down in the stomach and in the area where the bile dumps, you will find that these molecules are very very tiny. When you take a cooked food and you analyze that, you will find that these swell 5 to 50 times their normal size. So you take fat back, like the pork rind - and it is very very think - then you cook it - what happens? It is this big, swollen. Right now I am 19% body fat and I look like I am 7 - 10% body fat. That is because all the fat in my body has been made with very tiny raw molecules. I eat at least 2 pounds of raw unsalted butter weekly and a quart of raw cream and I mean heavy heavy thick cream which would be like 2 quarts of thin cream. I eat a tremendous amount of fats. I tell all of my cancer patients that they get should get - at least women - - at least 23 pounds overweight. And men should get at least 35 pounds overweight. Those fats are responsible for absorbing the toxins that are killing your cells.

If you have already collected a lot of cells, dead cells in the body, and you had cancer, you have to stop your body from collecting more. You have to make sure that it dissolves those dead cells so the body can eliminate it, perspire it or dump it out the intestines. Now you are not going to discharge it out the skin as the main organ unless your lymphatic system is working properly. So, let's get to how we do that.

OK, we have all the fats in the body, we have the protection. When any more toxins break down, we inhale any, anything comes in our environment, any that may be in the food… We have organic food but they lie - the FDA allows them to use 15% toxic substances even in organic food. So, to protect ourselves from this, we have all these fats. So, now we have the fats to protect us and to also dissolve the toxicity.

How do we get that lymphatic system moving? HOT BATHS. Saunas don't do it because they are too hot. ... even the infrared ones; they go up to 137 degrees. What temperate starts destroying the enzymes in the skin? 110 to 112 degrees. So we have to keep a constant temperature of about 108 degrees. ... for 90 minutes is what I found. I've seen tumors dissolve overnight if someone has been in a hot tub for 6 or 7 hours. It doesn't happen in every case. It does in most cases, if the tumor is deep. If the tumor is on the skin, that is a normal process. So, dissolve it with heat, water heat. Now if you have municipal water, you have a lot of contamination and if you are in L. A., proper L A, not in the valley, your water has been used 3 times before it gets there. It contains 196 chemicals. 'But it is bacteria free'. That is what the government tells you. 'Oh, it is bacteria free; it is safe'. But you have got all the industry here in the valley and up in Saugus before before it gets to L. A.. So you have 196 chemicals in the water, if you live in L. A. Here you've got 141 in the valley. So take a look at that. You need to protect yourself. I recommend putting about a cup of raw milk in the bath with about 3 tablespoons of raw apple cider vinegar and some sun dried sea salt. That will neutralize the poisons so that they don't get into your tissues and cause more problems.

Now when I used to get into the L. A. water, without those ingredients in it, I would be shaking like I had 5 cups of coffee, in just minutes. In 6 minutes, I would be a nervous wreck. So, I've had to experiment and learn how I can diffuse these toxins that were in the water. Just think about it, all the people who use paint thinner and in the industry they use all their solvents and muriatic acid. All of that is in the water and not filtered out well. So you have to protect yourself. So you get into... The hot tub is the best, like an Ofuro - a Japanese hot tub. I think you can get them for about $1850 now; they used to be $6,000. And then the works, if you get those in parts and have a plumber come and put it all together, you can have the whole set-up for about $2500. And let me tell you - that is the best money you will ever spend besides good nutrients. So you dissolve those dead cells. You make it so your lymphatic system can dissolve dead cells on a daily basis because you loose a tremendous amount of cells every day. And if you don't dissolve them, they will collect. That is why cancer can grow so quickly. And it isn't the growth of the cancer cells, as the cancer cell is the remedy. The cancer cell is the cure. Why, then it is that? Because when I fractionated the cancer cell, what I found was… it had a fluid in it that would dissolve anywhere from 50 to 200 dead cells that surround it. And, like I said, in any tumor, you will only have less than 1 - 2 percent cancer cells in this whole dead mass. So, the cancer cell, when it dies, it sends all of its fluid to dissolve all of this dead tissue around there.

Your body had better be fat and prepared to deal with that kind of dissolved toxicity because whatever has killed that cell, whatever industrial chemical has killed that cell, or compound - whatever it may be - will cause more damage. It can dissolve your whole tissue.

And it is very easy to take the hot baths and eat properly. Reversing cancer is that easy if you know what you are doing and you understand it. You don't have to have this vitamin supplement and that vitamin supplement and you hear all this stuff... iodine, iron... We are not plants. Plants eat rock. We don't eat rock. We only digest minerals properly and utilize them properly when they are a composite of food - raw food.

And salt is one of the worst things a cancer patient – anybody - can do, next to cooking. Why is that? Because sodium is an explosive. It is more volatile than nitroglycerin. If you take pure sodium and put it into one block about the size of a football, it will take out New York City and all of its buildings - just one block that size. My father worked on... he was an inventor... he worked on the first bearing computer, he worked on jet engines for the military and General Electric. They were given 2 million dollars to make sodium into a weapon. Well, it was so volatile that just 1 1/2 degree temperature change would set it off. They couldn't control it anywhere like nitroglycerin and they still don't use nitroglycerin as a weapon because they can't control it. Sodium is worse.

So what happens when salt… it has other minerals bound with it unless of course unless it is sodium chloride or sodium iodide which is manufactured. So that neutralizes it. While it is in your mouth you can hear it popping and you can hear it cutting into the mucus. When you gargle with it, it breaks down mucus. It is an explosive.

So what happens when it gets into the blood? Your body separates the sodium and all of a sudden it starts exploding. Now when a cell eats, it eats 93 to 117 nutrients - every nutrient on this planet - in a smorgasbord. And a cell opens by ionization and it absorbs that smorgasbord in and eats a balanced diet. When you use salt, even just two little bitty grains at a meal, you will kill 2 million red blood cells and make every cell in your blood deficient. It will break that molecule... it starts breaking up those clusters of smorgasbord and the cell may get anywhere from, 23 to 70 nutrients instead of 93 to 117. So your body goes under constant deficiency.  because you use salt. Salt is the big way that the king and queen of England use to subjugate a lot of people for a very very long time. And the king and queen of England, that family, owns almost all of the salt manufacturing in the world. And it is not a good thing. Sure, it helps preserve food; it will help mummify you... of what... dead cells. What is cancer? ... a collection of dead cells.

And again, like Dr. Samuel Epstein said, one in every two men gets cancer, one in every 3 women - today. That is a horrible rate. How can that be? OK, we look back and we see where the start of it began after world war two. Now what was world war two? In my research, I found that world war two was used to bring in canned and preserved foods, industrially canned. What happened immediately after the canned foods came in, after world war two?  Tonsillitis and poliomyelitis, two metal forming diseases that dissolve the spinal cord and the tonsils. The tonsils protect the brain from any kind of toxin that is in the food that you eat. And it started rotting and deteriorating the tonsils exponentially. They didn't blame it on the canned foods. What they did was... starting in '61, the king and queen of England - who ran 70 percent of and owned 70% of all the food manufacturing in the world - started lining the tin cans inside with plastic. That is when plastic came in the fold. They didn't tell you. They didn't want to tell you why they were all of a sudden plasticizing the inside because people would have linked a lot of diseases - like tonsillitis and polio - to that. And then what happened in 1958: the drop in polio... down to less than 1 percent. And that is when the vaccines came out the year after. But they cured polio. Nonsense. No vaccine has ever cured anybody of anything and prevented anybody of anything.

When I did research from '93 to '96 at the Sorbonne institute in France, three months of the year for those three years, a little over three years, I have translated... I can read a lot of French but I can't do all of that, not in technical form. so I had a translator with me - and not ONE of the animals, not one animal ever survived Pasteur's vaccines. They all went into anaphylactic shock and died. You have to take a look at that. Why did they die? Because when the body has that kind of toxicity in it, it supposes that it is going to die. That's it; it is going to die. So it goes into anaphylactic shock and dies. So, what did the pharmaceutical industry - Rockefeller and them - decide to do? They started putting formaldehyde in first. And they found that fewer animals went into anaphylactic shock, then they went into putting mercury and other substances in it, liquid aluminum, mercury, formaldehyde, ether and detergent were the main ones. No ingredient in a vaccine is safe. They are all toxic on their own account. And when you put them into a soup, what do you have? So, don't let anybody ever tell you that you are a bad parent. Just say to them 'OK', I have the research - I think you can go to my website; I think it is there. [https://www.primaldiet.net/hard-look-at-disease-instigated-by-corporate-and-governmental-tyranny/]. I don't run the website but you can go to WeWant2Live.com [aka primaldiet.net] and get what is in the vaccines. And you take that to a doctor or your school or whatever it is and you say 'can you explain to me how these can be safe and good when they are toxic; they are known toxins?'. And then you get them to sign a waiver that they take responsibility for anything that happens up to a million dollars and they won't do it and you won't have to have vaccines: [https://www.primaldiet.net/vaccination-acceptance-responsibility-form/].

If you want to reverse cancer, you have to stay away from doctors, you have to stay away from medication, you have to stay away from anything that is going to cause damage to cells in your body and collect dead cells. It is that easy. My diet, the Primal Diet (TM) works very very well in removing cancer pretty quickly and other diseases along with the hot tub baths.

Thank you very much for everyone coming and I hope I have helped you.

[Comment from Jim: I was there and here is what I saw: immediately following Aajonus's talk, he walked off stage and up the side of the room leading outside of the auditorium. Immediately, approximately 20 people stood up and followed him outside. There was a very intense Q&A (the recording has been lost over the years) with all kinds of questions. Aajonus was talking to an audience of people who did not know about the Primal Diet. Outside of the hall, We Want To Live: the Primal Diet books were available. I mention this because you may introduce people to the Primal Diet with the above transcript. After the above introduction, Aajonus would have them buy and read We Want To Live: the Primal Diet then pursue it if they wish.]

[Comment from Aajonus.net: The recording has not been lost. Here's the Q&A]

Q&A:

A: The way you can tell whether a fruit is truly organic is rub it like this and then rub a little bit around your nostril and a little bit around the outside of the eye. If you start itching, it is a lie. It's unorganic. If I have a fruit like that that I have to eat. There's nothing else. I will take about two cups of water and then I'll put about two ounces of milk in it and a quarter of a teaspoon of vinegar. Then I put my fruit in there and I shake it. I mainly berries and watermelons and things like that. I don't eat the heart of the watermelon. Cherries are low in sugar too.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Sprouts are very, very bad. I don't care what kind of sprouts they are. If you put a bird on sprouts, they can kill it. Only sprouts can kill them in three days. In the grain by itself, you have phytic acid. That's what they tell you to germinate the grain or sprout it to get the phytic acid out of whatever grain it is. But what the problem is, is that you generate three other enzymes that behave exactly like phytic acid. So you have a three pound complex there. See, the vegetarians and those people don't take the biochemistry all the way. That's the problem. So that's why it will kill a bird in three to five days if you feed them only sprouts. You will die if you eat only sprouts. I've seen many people that have gone on a sprout fasting, feasting diet and they've gotten very sick by the third day. Severe diarrhea. Because they stopped absorbing minerals. They stopped digesting certain minerals. They stopped absorbing and digesting nutrients. And then the fats, so it's compound.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: All enzymes are processed. They do it with kerosene derivatives.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: It doesn't make any difference. All of them have to use kerosene. The only way you can get good enzymes is you eat a tablespoon of papaya or pineapple. It's as easy as that. If you want a digestive supplement, you take a tablespoon of papaya or a tablespoon of pineapple with your meal. It's that easy.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Coconut butter is highly processed. Coconut cream is good. Coconut oil fermented is good.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: All of them are concentrated in sodium. All of them cause damage. The only way you can get concentrated sodium is by eating tomatoes, celery juice and watermelon. And those are not harmful.

Q: What about seaweed?

A: We don't digest seaweed. Watermelon, celery juice. Dulse you can't digest. When I did experiments with algae and dulses and any kind of seaweed, 98% of it passed in the feces undigested. We are not water creatures to begin with to deal with all the sodium. And we don't digest vegetation. And that's sea-based, heavy salt vegetation.We digest 1% to 2% of it. Your best mineral supplement is taking raw unsalted cheese and eating it with a tiny bit of honey. Like 6 to 1.

Q: [unintelligible]

Q: Correct. Unsalted.

A: No salt, raw cheese.

Q: You said that cheese is the best mineral supplement?

A: Pardon?

Q: You said cheese is the best mineral supplement?

A: Your best food mineral supplement is cheese with honey.

Q: No salt.

A: Any unheated honey. They can heat raw honey up to over 170 degrees. You can even take unheated honey and heat it up to 100, 200, 221 degrees and call it unheated. You have to ask the farmer, listen. I want... You have to ask the beekeeper that he never heats the honey to bottle it or extract it. It should never go over 93 degrees. Now let me tell you what honey is. The bee collects the nectar, swallows it, predigests it, and makes an insulin-like substance that converts 90% of the carbohydrate into enzymes for digesting and utilizing protein and fats. When it gets back to the hive, it vomits. That's what honey is. Predigested bee vomit. It's delicious, isn't it? You have to get away from all this icky, bacterious crap. We live, we are bacteria. Look at all the animals go around licking each other's butts all the time. Do they have a problem? No, that's good bacteria. It feeds their brain. E. coli is responsible. The fecal matter is responsible for feeding the brain and the nerves.

Q: You're not suggesting we eat shit.

A: For some people, I know that they do it when they can't eat meat. Like in Georgia, Russia, the poor people, they eat fecal matter. It's predigested by the herbivore, the cow or the buffalo, and it's predigested. Those cows and buffaloes have digested 58% to 67% of the fecal matter. Then when we put it in our systems, it'll get through in 24 hours. But it's not very good-tasting, smelling stuff unless that's all you have. They love the smell.

Q: Yeah, because the only person [unintelligible] is dogs.

A: Dogs do it a lot. A lot of animals do it.

Q: Kids do that too.

A: You just only see dogs.

Q: Babies do it.

Q: Their poop?

Q: Yeah.

Q: They play with it.

Q: They don't know that it's...

A: Absolutely, yeah.

Q: They make finger drawings.

A: In this book, I have 82 sauces that can be made in 3 to 5 different ways. That's 400 raw meat sauces, and they're incredible. Stroganoff, everything.

Q: What about raw wine?

A: Raw wine? You've got alcohol. It's going to do nerve damage. It's going to do liver damage. If you do like the French do, or used to before they got paranoid with fats, they also used to eat a lot of creams with their meals, and they could handle the wine because the fat absorbed the alcohol, and it didn't damage the liver or the nervous system. So if you're one of those who have to have wine, make sure that you have some raw cream or raw butter first before you drink it.

Q: How about fermented sauerkraut? Naturally done.

A: Yes, but again, it's a vegetation.

Q: So?

A: And it will interfere with your digestion of meats and animal products.

Q: Well, if you're just doing it, I thought that the old people, the old people who were working everywhere in the East and...

A: It works for people who eat cooked food.

Q: Right. It helps the digestion.

A: It helps the digestion if you eat cooked foods.

Q: Okay, if you're eating raw, you don't need it.

A: Exactly. It's harmful if you eat raw.

Q: Can I change the subject and ask you a question? What do you think about the ratio between calcium absorption and silica? Since we're supposed to be going to a silica base.

A: Like I said, in there, you don't have to worry about any of that chemistry. Forget all of that chemistry.

Q: Silica.

A: You get silica in all foods.

Q: Yeah, but how do you absorb it? It's the whole deal.

A: Eat it raw, so it isn't cauterized.

Q: So what is a good silica product? Tell me.

A: Strawberries.

Q: Right.

A: Cucumbers. Any, you know, zucchini. Any of those are high in silica.

Q: And celery. No?

A: No. No, because it's a high sodium, you won't utilize the silica very well.

Q: How can celery be high sodium when it tastes so bland? It's lovely. It's very interesting.

A: That's because it doesn't have any carbohydrates.

Q: Oh.

A: Celery is a negative. If you're having celery juice, there's not enough carbohydrates to digest celery.

Q: So what do you have? Tomatoes? Tomato and carrots?

A: Okay. Well, if you're looking for silica, you know, you want, well.

Q: And how about milk products for cows? Do they absorb silica from the grass?

A: Absolutely.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Yeah, but again, you can juice it, but don't eat it whole.

Q: Do you juice fruit?

A: No, never juice fruit.

Q: Why not?

A: Because the sugar will rush into your system fast and cause damage.

Q: How about wheatgrass?

Q: Wheatgrass. Wheatgrass.

Q: [unintelligible]

Q: Do you care for fruits? [unintelligible]

A: Not true.

Q: You never have fruits.

A: Yes, I eat fruits. Whole fruits with fat. Always with fat.

Q: No more jamba juice?

A: Raw cheese? Let me finish. I eat the fruit always with either raw no salt cheese or cream or butter. Or avocado. Because it slows down the sugar reaction. And in the citric acid cycle of making energy, your body uses 80% fat, 15% proteins as a form of pyruvate, which is a protein sugar, and then 5% vitamin C or carbohydrate. So we just need a small amount of the sugar. So if I supply the fats, and let's say I take a tablespoon of cream, that will be a ratio of about calorie-wise, fat-wise, about six times greater than the sugar. And if I add another half a tablespoon, I've got around the 80-15-5 ratio. Yeah, but I usually go overboard. I like more fat with it, so I don't have to deal with any advanced glycation end product that results from high sugar foods.

Q: What about [unintelligible]?

A: Absolutely. So anybody who's in an advanced case, like in this book I talk about this woman who had emphysema. Her MD called me on a Thursday night. It must have been 1.30 her time. So it was like 9.30 my time or 10.30 my time here. And she says, I have an emphysemic patient who was diagnosed seven years ago. She's been bedridden for almost two years. She's on machines for two years. She's going to die this weekend. What can I do? I say you're calling me a little late, aren't you? And she said, well, I'm a doctor. I have to follow the medical AMA prescribed medical procedures, which are written by the pharmaceutical industry, for ten years. If it fails for ten years, I can suggest alternatives. If the patient is on their deathbed, I can suggest alternatives. So that's why she was coming to me. If you go to a doctor, know that you're condemned to pharmaceutical therapies for ten years. You can never suggest anything else. So going to a doctor is nonsense, a regular medical doctor. So I said, well, the only thing that I can suggest that you do is you get the most easily digested food in the world, which are eggs. They can digest them in 27 minutes. Milk is the next most quickly digested food. It takes six to ten hours. So I said, what you need to do is get her 10 to 15 dozen raw eggs, put them at her bedside, and let her eat as many as she can. There's no limit.

Q: You mean raw?

A: Raw, of course. So I got a call on Monday morning from this raspy-voiced woman saying, it worked, I'm out of bed, what should I do? And I said, well, who are you? And she said, well, my doctor told you I have emphysema. I was supposed to die this weekend. I ate all the eggs you recommended. I'm out of bed and off the machines. What do I do now? I said, keep eating eggs. But how many did it take? She said, well, I ate 33 on Saturday and 33 on Sunday. She said, I'm off the machines, out of bed. Eggs are so vital because you're only using five inches of the digestive tract to absorb and digest it. You don't need any hydrochloric acid. You use the bacteria in your mouth to begin it, like with salivary sucking and getting saliva. Bacteria is the only thing necessary to digest a liquid food like that. Milk is more complex. You need some hydrochloric acid. Bacteria doesn't. So you're able to recoup very quickly because eggs are every nutrient on this planet. It's the only food that has it. However, it lacks the ability to multiply growth hormones. So you won't heal, you won't divide cells quicker. You will rebuild all the cells that are already alive.

A: In India, they don't have as many products. Like just in India last year, they came out with a new soda, which is from cow's urine. In India, they drink a lot of urine because they're vegetarians and recycle their proteins and B vitamins, especially B12. Your urine is nothing other than your blood without the red blood cells, with a little ammonia in it. So if your blood is healthy, your urine is going to be healthy. There's nothing wrong with it. One time, I passed an experiment for 45 days on drinking urine. I only lost 10 pounds. 45 days of fasting. When I fasted for 32 days, and I'm not for fasting. It was just for an experiment. When I fasted for just water, in 32 days, I lost 60 pounds. I went down to 96 pounds. I don't drink water. Water is dangerous. It will dilute your digestive enzymes, nutrients, mostly alkaline. It will alkalinize your digestive juices, and it's not good. If you're eating raw foods, everything contains predominantly water. Meat's 70-55% water. Milk is 86% water. And fruits, 92-93% water. And it's mineral, and enzymes, and vitamin-rich, nutrient-rich water that your body can use. If you just drink water, what happens? You get thirstier. The more water you drink, the thirstier you get.

Q: So what do you use for liquid?

A: I drink milk. I drink two quarts of milk a day.

Q: Goats or cows milk?

A: I drink cows milk. I get too thin if I drink goats.

Q: You get raw milk?

A: All the way. Everything I eat is raw.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: No, you can eat rotten meat galore. The Eskimos eat rotten meat. I eat lots of rotten meat. It's pre-digested.

Q: [unintelligible]

Q: So people get cold.

A: People get what?

Q: People get cold a lot from eating cheese.

A: Only if they're eating it cooked. If you eat those things raw, they'll warm the body. If you eat cheese and honey together, you will heat up quickly. If you're a person goes around with cold feet and cold hands, you eat raw, no-salt cheese with unheated honey, and you're going to get warm very quickly.

Q: I have two quick questions. What do you recommend for a diabetic or vegetarian? I'm a vegetarian, and I'm not going to eat meat.

A: Will you eat eggs?

Q: Yeah.

A: Well, if you do okay with it, fine. I have a lot of clients that just do dairy and eggs, and just a few that do just dairy. They're mainly women, and they do okay with them. If you do okay with that, you're fine. If you find that you're demineralizing, or you're not strong as you want to be, and your stomach is distended, then I would say you need to eat at least once in a while. The Dalai Lama got very sick seven years ago. Fred Siegel, the famous and very wealthy Fred Siegel, was a good friend of the Dalai Lama. He was on my diet for a few years. So the Dalai got sick. Fred flew over there and said, Hey, I'm on this diet. Look at me. When I took Fred, he was 68 years old and like this. He was on a vegetarian diet. His wife was a vegetarian. She's been a vegetarian for about seven years. Went on my diet for just 18 months, and became strong. 18 months after that, the Dalai Lama got sick. He went to the Dalai Lama and said, Wow, you look great, Fred. What are you doing? He says, I'm eating raw meat. I'm eating this raw diet. The Dalai Lama that day ate raw meat. He says, I'm not going to stick with vegetarianism, even though that was my teaching, if it doesn't serve me. He says it's his medicine, and he eats the meat today, because it's medicine. You have to balance your philosophy with that. I thought that was the most brilliant vegetarian I've ever heard of, because he was willing to change.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Good for any of the red meat tissue, muscles. Pancreas, spleen, liver, gallbladder, muscles. I always eat butter with my meat. Not cream, unless it's sour cream, because it coats it, and it doesn't digest well with fresh cream.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Sugar cane, agave is completely processed. Sugar cane, when you get it, you find you can juice it. When I'm in Asia, that's my main vegetable juice is sugar cane. I even grow it beside my house in Thailand. I will juice that, and that's my main juice. I will add other things to it, I'll juice some carrots, something like that. The sugar cane is fine. The only time I found it caused a heightened sugar level was in children. It didn't cause them to be crazy, but it caused them to be more hyperactive.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: I suggest that people eat two tables- one and a half to two tablespoons of butter with a half a pound of meat. We're going to have to cut this out really soon. My books are available, and the DVDs are also there.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: They say it's [unintelligible] infection? They don't know what they're talking about. Do I look like I have a problem with my brain? I've been eating raw meat since 1976, three days a week since December of 1982, every day.

Q: What's your blood pressure like?

A: What was it, I just had it done a week ago... 76/110. High blood pressure is good if you need it. The doctors want to put you on high blood pressure medication, you're in trouble. If you have high blood pressure, that means you have caked arteries or veins, or you're overweight and you have pressure on your arteries and veins. You need high blood pressure. Everybody needs high cholesterol in our toxic society.

[audio cut]

A: I've got a Hall of Fame basketball player who's just turned 90 this year, and his cholesterol level stays on my diet 672, and he outdoes the teenagers on the ball field at 90 years old.

Q: 672? He has no problem with plaque?

A: No. I had plaque in this carotid artery, carotid artery, since I was a child. And then last year, I go have my system checked with an ultrasound, usually every three to four years. Let me finish. So, I decided, well, I'm going to see what I can do to break this down. I know that vinegar and pineapple are a great, break down things very well. So, I decided to do it in conjunction with cucumber juice, which is high in silicone. It will help the membranes in the skin. So, I made a mixture every three days of this mixture and drank it. I just had my carotid artery checked four weeks ago, completely cleaned. Every year, to come back with the right one, they showed the photograph. This time, since I did that, and I only did it for nine months, two to three days a week, and in that amount of time, it completely cleaned that carotid artery.

Q: What was the mixture?

A: The rate I used, about a cup of, or three-quarters of a cup of cucumber juice, a tablespoon of vinegar, an ounce of pineapple, and I put a tablespoon of, two tablespoons of coconut cream, and a tablespoon of dairy cream, and it came out to about a cup.

Q: And you blended it?

A: I blended it, yes. And I peeled the cucumber, because that's vegetation we won't digest, and it's sliced into circular slices.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: You've got more questions answered than anybody.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Well, fasciitis are the protective tissues, usually in the foot, and they get collected, but they have toxins, so they start hardening dead cells in there, they don't have the elasticity, and they start buckling. That's a problem. You can put clay packs, moist clay packs, you have to keep them wet, all night long with hot water bottles around that, that'll rush the nutrients in there, and then the clay will also draw the toxins out through the skin.

Q: What's the name of the clay?

A: Terramin clay is the name. T-E-R-R-A-M-I-N Now, I suggest that eating-wise, you get the terrasilk, not the terramin. Use the terramin for your face, do just the opposite of what they say.

Q: Do you have classes or something?

A: Well, no, I have a DVD here. You know, you can watch it many times. It's five hours long.

Q: Wow.

Q: So, you're not teaching or doing anything?

A: I do that all over the world, but not here in L.A.

Q: How about the desert?

A: I haven't done it in California, except in Northern California.

Q: What states do you visit?

A: I do it in many, many states. You have to get on my email list. Optimal@earthlink.net, Optimal@earthlink.net You email me, I'll put you on my email list, and you'll get notified. Next, I'll be going to Asia, and then to Australia.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Well, you can do that, but you also have a lot of damage to the system. I don't find it a safe way to do it.

Q: The Chinese [unintelligible].

A: But they're also using chemicals in that process. And when I did the fecal test, and the urinary test to check, they always say, they use a pig test and say, well, 90% of it is removed from the body in 42 hours. That's in pigs. In human urine and feces, I've only seen 24% of it. So, you've got those chemicals now in your body, even though you don't have a plaque. Now what are you going to do? Are you going to get thrombosis, or varicose veins? That's what you're going to end up with. So you have to watch your treatments. Even though they may work, they can have side effects.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: No, the plaque can get dissolved, but also the chemicals in the formulas that they use to do that start eating into the arterial vein.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: No, because those foods are processed. There's a chemical involved there. You check it out. Check the chemistry all out. You say, absolutely, I want to know everything that's in this product that you use to clean the system. And it's not plant-based. You can have plant-based, but if it's treated with kerosene, you've got kerosene in it. I don't care if it's plant-based. You can have vitamins, plant-based. Kerosene in it. A lot of other chemicals.

Q: [unintelligible] The guy said that it's [unintelligible].

A: Very toxic? No, that's not full kerosene. That's just dried, dead stuff. Good minerals for the plant. And if you have liquid whey [unintelligible].

Q: [unintelligible]

A: It'll pump you up. It'll give you a lot of minerals. It'll build your muscles up. Excuse me, did you have a question?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: No dehydrated food because there's no water in it. You destroy the enzymes in the dehydrated food. You don't digest but maybe 5 to 10% of it. Unless it's something like raisins or dates, then you will digest a lot of sugars from it. But better have a lot of fat. You're going to have a lot of advanced glycogen. What?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: But I don't know that. I don't know that.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Well, he's a, what do they call it, instincto. He eats a lot of fruit, 60% fruit. He also has a serious psychological problem. He gets angry quickly. He doesn't sit well. He doesn't read well. He's got a new problem. I want to be able to sit, have a good relationship, and not be yelling at people. He eats way too much fruit.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: You didn't get cancer from your meat, it's impossible. You get cancer from building red dead blood cells. Well, cancer is a breakdown of dead cells. Her liver is probably not producing bile to produce fat to help the lymphatic system dissolve dead cells and remove them from the body. Or her lymphatic system doesn't work.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: [unintelligible] You keep vomiting, you keep regurgitating your vomit, and you know you're producing it. Or if you're regurgitating, you get that acid, that nasty, bitter acid. Hydrochloric acid is not bitter. It's bile. It's a bitter acid. [unintelligible] Also, you can tell if, in your feces, you've got raw cream that comes through and it's, like, pearlized and shiny, and it coats everything. It's not digested.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: I already talked about that. Yeah. Remember, parasites are your best friends. They get rid of dead cells and toxins in your body.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: You have rectal damage?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Well, when you have that kind of situation, it's the only thing that's going to get it all going. I talk about salt all the time. No matter what kind of salt it is, you got high-content rock salt. We don't eat rock in the first place. And when we eat rock salt, no matter if it's Celtic, Dead Sea, or whatever it is, your body will [unintelligible] and separate, isolate the [unintelligible].

Q: You heard his lecture.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: I recommend 5%. I recommend people do 10%. I've been on this diet for too long. I only want to sleep 4 hours a day and work 20 hours a day. If I'm 10% [unintelligible], I will sleep 6 hours. That means 2 hours of the day I've lost.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: 8,000? Or more?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Well, usually I'll have my vegetable juice first thing in the morning. Cheese first. And then about 30 minutes after that, vegetable juice. About 35, 40 minutes after that, I eat my meat meal. And then I'll sit on milk. Or my sport formula. And then about somewhere between noon and 2 o'clock, I'll have my fruit and some kind of fat. Like today, I have berries, and milk, and cream, and eggs. Six eggs. I [unintelligible] the afternoon. Then I'll have my meat again in the evening. Or during the night.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Like I said, my wheatgrass is very bad. Is there more books out here? Would you like me to sign?

Q: Yeah.

Q: Do you have more DVDs out here?

A: Pardon?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Wheatgrass has a tendency to make the intestinal tract alkaline and the blood acidic. And you need just the opposite. The intestinal tract needs to be acidic to digest your animal.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Yeah, well, you don't want to over-acidify the blood. The blood should be about 5-5 for humans. You know, all these alternatives say, oh, we should get it up to 6.5, 6.77, something like that. If you did that, you wouldn't digest anything. They don't eat protein with fats. Mine's been 5.5 for 28 years.

Q: What's your take on the [unintelligible]?

A: I send out an email, and you can get it in the newsletters. You can subscribe to the newsletters. $85 a year. I get all of my letters back to 2006, and that's about 1,200 pages. That's going to be my next book. So I've got all that stuff in there, what to do to offset. Because there's a lot [unintelligible].

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Yeah, but that would be out in a year. But you can get all the information already if you subscribe to my newsletter.

Q: The very first thing you eat is cheese. [unintelligible]

A: I eat a tablespoon and a half of cheese first thing. When you eat unsalted raw cheese alone, it will absorb all the poisons that are in your stomach and intestines, and you'll pass out in pieces. If you eat salted raw cheese, you'll reabsorb it with the salt. It explodes and breaks it down. It digests it for you. If you eat pasteurized cheeses or homogenised cheeses, they will re-digest your poisons again.

Q: But one tablespoon of cheese?

A: One and a half tablespoons of cheese.

Q: What type of cheese? Cottage cheese?

A: It's up to you. It doesn't matter. As long as it's raw, no salt.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: No, cottage cheese is normally cooked. But you just let it sit and clabber, and then you pour that into the cheesecloth like a good t-shirt, like this material, organic, sewed into a sock, and then you pour the clabbered milk into that, and then all of the whey drains out and you catch that and you drink that, and then you've got this cheese out of the cheesecloth. You let it dry as dry as you want it, just add a little cream to it.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Okay. Pancreas has nothing to do with digestion, except that it's an architect. It tells the body what enzymes it needs to make, to break down the food molecules and reconvert them into human cells or human nutrition. And pancreas doesn't actually do anything except adress it. But it will if you eat excessive fruits or excessive sugars. It has to make insulin.Normally, pancreas does almost nothing with insulin. Insulin used to be just a fraction of the diet, [unintelligible]. It was supposed to be only 5%. Lucy, 4.3 million years ago, had a pancreas two and a half times smaller than now. She was a meat eater, raw meat eater. She didn't eat fruit. And when you live outdoors, like I did for three years, you don't find fruit everywhere. And where you find it, the birds eat it all. So you do not, primates did not eat a lot of fruit. That is absolutely paleolithic bullshit. Excuse my, but when I hear somebody come up with that theory and they never lived outdoors long enough to know what goes on, and I bicycle all the way from Yucatan to Alaska living off the land, and there are no fruits and vegetables. Absolutely none. And the birds get the [unintelligible].

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Absolutely. Well, in conjunction with the hot baths, the hot tub.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: I've had massive, I had lymphoma. I had them all over my body.

Q: Lypoma.

A: Lypoma is still a fat. Yeah, it's not a fat. It's usually a node. A lymphatic node is swollen with fat.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Yep, it could be. Absolutely.

Q: So what do I do?

A: Pack it with clay, keep it wet. Wrap some plastic over that without touching the skin. Keep it moist all night. Put a hot water bottle on it. Yeah, then you put the, like, wrap the towel around the hot water bottle so it stays in the heat. It's concentrated into the arm.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Well, she'd be doing a good diet. Yeah, eat some pineapple and coconut cream. I had a woman who had one this big and she was crippled three years ago when she came to me in Chicago. She had a rheumatoid arthritis and all of her knuckles were like this. Big mineral lypoma, mineral lypoma. It was as big as a hardball right here. Her knees were blown out this big. All the toes, the joints were all crippled. So, here on the diet, she came back. She did a hot bath two days a week, 90 minutes a day, two days weekly. She came back, she was able to feed herself now. Her husband still had to do chores. She could stand up with holding something. Then, the next year, I said, you need to do more hot baths and just keep it up. And when she came back this year, I said to her husband, you're a strong guy. I said, look, you need to put her in every day, 90 minutes a day, and I'll bet you she'll walk in here next year. So, two months ago, I was in Chicago, and guess who walked in. That massive swelling went down in one year. And I've been there for 15 years. In those hot tubs. 90 minutes a day. And if you get too hot and you can't stay in, you just take an ice pack and put it on top of your head. It's the brain that hates to be overheated.

Q: What about if you use DMSO?

A: It's a poison. It's a chemical. Like I said, when people use DMSO internally, only 24% leaves the body. DMSO is a poison. It's a chemical. Okay, folks, we're going to have to end it there.

Q: Thank you.

Q: [unintelligible]

Q: Thank you. Frank, good job.

A: [unintelligible] Your ammonia is being built with fat. It's not a bad thing. It's not a bad thing, just eat pineapple and cheese.
