The Food Book

based on the works of

Aajonus Vonderplanitz

2021, by James Ellingson, compiled from written works of Aajonus Vonderplanitz.

“I will have all the information in books. They
won't need me when I have all the information;
that's what I'm working on. Everybody will be able
to take care of themselves if I give everybody
enough information." - Aajonus Vonderplanitz

Aajonus himself selected the contents of this
book.

He noted and quoted certain questions, answers
and subjects that were important to
communicate to Primal Dieters.

He placed these in a folder on a hard drive to
further prepare at a later point. These are
labeled as he labeled them. He named this collection of data: The Food Book.

As is the case with his books We Want To Live:
the Primal Diet and The Recipe for Living Without
Disease , this information is meant to be used to
regain and improve health. One point can be
significant at one time and another point can
mean a lot at another time. Personally, I have had some realizations and have made some
important and very beneficial changes in my
regimen as a result of covering this material. We
present this to you for your benefit.

Note that clicking on a point in the Table of
Contents takes you directly to that subject in the
text. Note also the glossary is there to assist you.

WINE

Q: Organic wine – is it permissible on the diet?

A: Growing up in the world today, one is
bombarded with ‘If you have a liver problem,
you do not even want to touch it’. People who
have a very strong liver or have enough weight
on them can get by with 2-4 oz a week. Raw un-
pasteurized wine with no formaldehyde in it –
that means no wines out of California.

Q: Next, I have had two half glasses of wine over
the last six months and on both occasions within a
half hour of each my right side begins to shut
down. I am interested in the underlying problem
that this may signal and I do not intend to have
wine again. Is this a brain problem and what to do?

A: Alcohol destroys nerve cells. Your loss of
function likely indicates that MS [multiple
sclerosis] may be developing. Do not drink any
alcohol. Get raw cream!

DEMENTIA

Alcohol in a body that consumes cooked fats is
beneficial to a limit because it helps produce
solvents to liquefy cooked fats that normally
harden, causing circulatory blockages in
nervous system, including brain, veins and
lymph. On a raw diet, anymore alcohol than 2
ounces a week causes liver and neurological
damage.

ALGAE – SPIRULINA, ETC.

When you cook food, minerals cauterize. You
destroy potassium at about 100 degrees,
calcium is only half utilizable if you take it over
104 degrees. When you take cauterized
minerals, then they’re toxic heavy metals. When
you eat cooked sea vegetables you’re going to
get more metal poisoning and free radicals in
your body. I have not seen any form of these in
fish. The fish have particular systems to digest
these complex cellular structures. It takes a
specific intestinal bacteria to break it down.

I am going to be doing some tests. I need 15
people or more. I am getting liquid form
spirulina active bacteria – blue green algae. I am
going to test to see if it has any significant difference. It takes about 8 weeks to consume it.
It won’t hurt you because it won’t be cooked and
it might benefit you because you’ll get a certain
amount of sustainable minerals if we can digest
them. The test is to see if we can. You would
have to drink about a gallon of this a month or
two months – drinking about 2 oz. a day in place
of 2 oz. of vegetable juice. You have to keep it
refrigerated. It will cost about the same amount
as the veg. juice. He’ll look at the nails, eyes –
certain identifications that will tell him if there’s
an influx of minerals i.e. nail layer. It takes
about 6 months to grow a nail out. Thumb and
big toe takes about 9 mos. to a year. Small toe
about 6 months. If you take the spirulina for a
couple of months, I’ll be able to tell if there’s a
change in the nail layer. When you freeze dry it
you cannot rehydrate it again in your body. I
have not been able to get the algae fresh and
live. Kathy found it. It has taken about 1 year.

Q: Aloe vera juice. I heard that there is not much
aloe vera in those commercial juices.

A: I am not talking about those commercial
juices. There is one that you get refrigerated.
The brand name I don’t recall. It is perfectly
fresh and it is done a few days before. It is
scraped, not juiced – it is very thick like mucus
or gelatin. [This was only available to a few
health food stores in Hollywood and West
Hollywood. It is no longer available.]

Q: Can you juice Aloe vera leaves?

A: No. What you do is scrape them. Slice them
and then scrap them out with a spoon. The
green peel has a poison for most people. It will
cause a tendency for liver cramping in some
people.

Q: Would it thin my blood out too much to have
the aloe vera?

A: She is asking if having the aloe vera would
thin her blood out too much because she is
having a problem with bleeding. It is not a
constant bleed as it was before she came on the
diet but there is still a little bit of discharge, and
membrane and a little bit of spotting. She is
wondering if taking the aloe vera juice will cause
more bleeding. It is possible if you get the green
in it, any of the peel. And it could cause more
bleeding so you just take the gel out of the
inside.

Q: Is aloe vera good for everybody?

A: Well, that would be good for a chemical
reaction that is causing the bleeding. Let’s say
Iodine was causing the burning in her body,
causing hemorrhaging inside the cells or extra-
cellularly in the system somewhere. You want to
stop the bleeding. It would all depend on the
individual. It would probably help that because
the iodine would be burning the tissue and aloe
vera is great for reversing that, for minimizing
the damage of a burn whether it be chemical or
heat.

Aloe Vera from the store has a shelf life of 2
weeks. Once opened, separate and put into 4 oz
jelly jars for preservation. However if the aloe
vera is juiced and not scraped off, it will only last
a few hours.

Avocado is difficult to digest for people with a
compromised liver. Every cancer client I have
seen has had a compromised liver, and probably
a direct link to cancer. I suggest a half avocado
and half an acid fruit every day.

Eating some bones is very beneficial to the
skeletal integrity. I have found that bone
conditions respond more rapidly on my diet
(called Primal Diet™ ) when fresh bones are
included. Because of slow digestion of bone, I
found that it is wise to consume no more than a
ping pong ball-sized amount per day. Some
people have been able to digest and utilize more
for short periods and many can only digest and
utilize less. As you do, I regularly consume
chicken and fish bones. Digestion and utilization
become more difficult if the bones are dried and
pulverized. Many people take a hunting knife
and shave off several tablespoon at a time.

Q: What guidelines do you follow about bone
marrow? We can get it from free range beef that
had some antibiotics at a month old and are killed
after at least a year.

A: Free-range beef is able to counteract a small
amount of antibiotics. If I experience any
swelling within 36 hours of eating bone marrow,
I will not eat anymore from that particular
animal.

The cinnamon. I have never seen cinnamon that
has not been cured with chlorine or strychnine.
So cinnamon is normally black. But to sell it as a
product they bleach it out and lighten it to a red.
So that is your problem there. If you can get
black cinnamon, terrific.

Q: Explain the difference between clay and why
that is digestible and why the plant based
colloidal minerals would be toxic.

A: Very different. There is a very high activity of
bacteria in the clay. It contains bodies which
are not identical in nature to - but similar to -
bone marrow. These cells in a clay can actually
shape shift. They can turn into amoebas. They
can turn into parasites. They can turn into any
bacterial form that your body needs. Just like a
bone marrow cell can become any cell in the
body. It can completely change its identity to a
liver cell. But the Clark mine water I think is
clay. The TJ Clark minerals are shale from Utah.
It has been boiled in the sun at 140 degrees and was not a real clay bed. It was a salt water sea
bed. And the salt water and high sodium
content completely rips out any bacteria. If it
were not salt water but mineral deposits were
actually a clay bed it would be different. A lot of
people call it a clay bed when it is not an actual
clay bed.

I am reminding most of you with another email,
and informing some of you for the first time,
about the latest information on healing clay.

First, I must digress. When I was ill and traveled
the continent on a bicycle, I learned that Native
Americans used clay to absorb poisons and help
healing. Pregnant natives ate a little clay daily to
prevent poisons from the mother's blood from
entering the fetus. I found that whenever I came
across a clay bed and ingested some, my acne
reduced or subsided for days or even weeks. My
trust in the healthy attributes of clay were
reinforced when I read the account of the
famous man who had ingested enough arsenic,
all in one guzzle, to kill several horses. Before his death, he revealed how he had survived the
poisoning without harm; he had consumed an
amount of clay that he knew would absorb the
amount of arsenic that he drank.

Without scrutiny, I assumed that all natural clay
promoted health. I have learned that my
assumption was incorrect.

The rozbod red clay that I had suggested
[around the year 2000] is being treated with
additives. If you are going to use clay, make sure
that it is not treated with chemicals nor has
additives.

After visiting Hawaii and being injured in the
volcanic rock, I learned that the molten metals in
it caused me pain and scarring. Subsequently, I
learned that some popular clays are from
bentonite from volcanic ash. The other clay that
I recommended was Aztec Secret Healing Clay
that is bentonite clay from volcanic ash.

I recommend that any bentonite clay be avoided
because of the risk of molten heavy metal-
poisoning. I experimented with it several times
in the last 18 months on wounds and found that
scarring was absolute. However, working with
the French green clay and another untreated
clay, they prevented scarring and pain.

Q: However, this interesting reference to a low-
cost, healing clay came my way. It was
recommended to me by a cooked-food eater, but it
looks like it might be helpful to anyone:
http://www.pascalite.com/ I was wondering if
you had ever taken it or heard of it.

A: This clay is not active in the beneficial soil
organisms we want in moist clay that has been
moist for centuries. It is basically powdered
rock.

Q: Coconuts have to be organic?

A: Palms have their roots as deep as it is high.
The toxicity gets built into the pulp. If they plant
bananas, etc. between the trees and spray
them... but otherwise they don’t have to be
organic. The ones wrapped in Saran wrap aren’t
any good because the wrap releases dioxins and
permeates into the nuts and spoils it. That’s why
it stinks and has a funny taste. Saran wrap is the
worst one. It’s like glue. It constantly releases,
like the mercury amalgams in your teeth.

Q: Young coconuts are good?

A: You don’t get the concentration of fat that you
get in more mature coconuts... not from
coconuts wrapped in cellophane. Cellophane
causes dioxide poisoning. The ones from China
and Thailand – dioxide.

Q: Also, a person just recently told me that all
young (green) coconuts are irradiated because
they all come from Asia and are zapped at the
border upon arrival. Have you heard this??

A: I do not eat the young coconuts that are
wrapped in cellophane because the phthalates
and dioxins from the wrap seep into the

coconut. All coconuts from Asia are cellophane-
wrapped. I do not know about the radiation.

Q: I forgot to ask you today about coffee. I love to
drink it. You'll probably say it's bad, but I am
curious if it's affecting me adversely in a
particular way that you can see.

A: It affects the nervous system, including brain.
It causes plaqing in tissues. It causes extreme
hunger in some people and makes their blood
too acid, then meat is repulsive.

Q: What does drinking a cup of coffee or eating
my morning bacon do to me?

A: Coffee is very acid and must be neutralized
during digestion, and that requires calcium-
based buffers. Coffee also stimulates your
adrenal glands which respond by causing
increased blood pressure and rapid heart rate.
Both of those symptoms are adjustments which require enormous amounts of enzymes and
nutrients, and energy to correct. Bacon, which is
cured with high concentrations of salt, requires
an expansion of your body fluids in order to
dilute the added salt into a large enough volume
of fluid to enable your kidneys to filter out the
excess and return your red blood cells to a
normal. Aspartame, the patented artificial
sweetener manufactured by Monsanto, contains
phenylalanine. These amino acids both contain
Phenyl, a form of formaldehyde. In solution at
86 degrees, formaldehyde separates from the
amino acid. The free amino acid is perceived as
sweet by receptors on the tip of your tongue.
Who, knowingly, would daily ingest
formaldehyde, including the mouthwash
Listerine?

Q: ... ate 4 or 5 Costco chocolate chip cookies.

A: ... many chemicals in Costco cookies.

Q: ... horrible headache for days--I never get
headaches--and have been feeling unusually
anxious and overwhelmed. Further, I have had
some very unpleasant heartburn. In fact, I have
this negative taste in my throat and, when I
cough, I experience a very bad taste and like an
acid burn in the throat or esophagus.

A: Crisco, rhymes with Costco, is hydrogenated
oil. Costco's cookies contain it and other oils
which are rendered plastics. It requires many
white and fatty cells to harness and detoxify
those and other chemical substances in those
cookies; approximately 55 to 1. Since you have
been on the Primal Diet your system was healthy enough to facilitate immediate
detoxification but not healthy enough to do it
without some symptoms of harm to the nervous,
and other, systems.

Q: I have learned the lesson, but think I may still
be feeling the after effects. Is that possible? It has
been two weeks now.

A: Yes. If there were a toxic waste-spill in the
water system of Los Angeles, how long do you
think that it would take for clean-up?

Q: Also is there anything that might help at this
point? I am very much back on the program.

A: For 3 1/2 days from now: at least 12 eggs
daily, 2 sugar-cubed-sized portions of cheese
every 1 1/2 hours, at least a half pound chicken,
and 2 oz. raw cream 4 times per day.

She asked me if she should alternate the
ingestion of soured butter and soured milk.

Any time you sour a dairy product, you are
predigesting it. Those bacteria, like for the baby,
the calf - its system is geared up to digest
properly. The milk has all of the bacteria so the
cow does not have to do much. It will teach the
digestive track of the calf how to eat, how to
break things down because when the mother
cuts them off they have to depend on their own
digestive tract to do everything. So anytime you
are souring a dairy product, you are
predigesting it; it will be easier for you to utilize.
So if you need more butter, let’s say you are
drier in your bones, in your joints, connective
tissue, in your skin or your lymph, butter is
always better for that. Milk is better for the
immediate glands, the blood, the organs, it will help sooth that better. You can never drink
enough cream - and you can never get enough
cream out right now with the situation we have -
to get the bones and the joints and lubricate
them. The butter is about the only way with the
lubrication formula, which is on the top of page
163.

Q: What about olive oil?

A: All your pressed oils... you are asking
questions when you shouldn’t be, because every
body has not gone around,... but that is such a
good question I will answer it anyway. The cold
pressed oils as I said... some 90 % are always
used for detoxification. They do not soothe or
lubricate the body. The body uses 90% or more
of that in solvent reaction. It is just like that
general in Russia during WW I who wrote in his
diary: “My men’s hair and skin stayed supple
and brilliant as long as we had our dairy.” And
at that time in WW I there was no pasteurization
in Russia. He said, “As soon as we had to rely on
cold pressed oils like olive oil within 3 months
their hair and skin dried out.”

Q: What is raw clabbered milk?

A: Well I have been experimenting with it for
years. If you take milk and you take about 6 oz
out, you can do it. He said it took him 8 hours
less than 3 days in his room temperature to
clabber to the point it looked like yogurt.

Q: Curdle you mean?

A: No, clabber. If you let it go longer, then the
water will completely separate and you will
have curdled milk which you can make cottage
cheese with.

Q: Does it have the acidophilus in it?

A: No, the bacteria are more important in the
animal. Acidophilus is not natural. All of those are created to help digest the proteins, sugars,
and fats. Each one of those will break down one
of those substances. The milk naturally has
those substances in them so if you let them work
on the milk before you ingest them you will
infuse them into you. This will help you generate
your own. If you take acidophilus supplements,
even the kefirs, it will not help you regenerate
your own. It will just predigest it for you so you
get the milk but still will not break it down into
the most appropriate molecular disassembling
that is for you the individual. So let the milk do
it.

Q: How do you make kefir?

A: Just let the raw milk sit at room temperature.

Q: You can get it overnight if you leave a bottle on
the stove if it has a pilot light on. Do you cover it?

A: Yes. The reason I do not like to leave it on the
fridge is because of the EMFs that come off the
fridge are put in it. They broadcast like 3 feet.
EMF’s change the RNA and DNA structure of the
milk. The only things you can mix with
vegetable juice are coconut cream and raw
cream.

Q: Does clabbered milk get eaten with meat?

A: Yes.

Q: Do you recommend the clabbered milk all the
time?

A: You know I do not digest it well when it is
fresh. I do it [clabber milk] all the time. And
when I drink it fresh, I tend to drink more and I
dehydrate easily.

Q: What do you mean by keep it going?

A: It takes 3 days to get it to the clabbered point.

Q: Do you refrigerate it afterwards?

A: Yes. If you are not going to drink it all I will.
See I stagger it and take two out a day. As I
drink 2 I will put 2 more out.

Q: I received my viili today (no kefir is available
till after Thanksgiving). Do I just follow the
instructions except use raw milk?

A: I do not use bought viili to culture my milk. I
simply let my milk stand outside of the
refrigerator until it thickens without separation.
The bacteria that naturally exist in the milk are
prime for pre-digestibility, climate and freshness.

Q: By doing that you are just keeping your milk
out on the counter for 2-3 days.

A: Correct.

Q: You are making it like a yogurt?

A: Correct. The first day it is off, it has a sour
taste that I am not comfortable with. My body
isn’t anyway. After the second day it is still thin
but it is palatable. But on the third day,
somewhere along the day it solidifies.

Q: Do you get the same effect with yogurt?

A: There is no raw yogurt.

Q: Raw buttermilk?

A: Raw buttermilk will not do quite the same
because it is not cultured. If it is cultured
buttermilk, well then, yes it is allowed to age and
let its own bacteria grow.

Q: There is no raw yogurt available?

A: No. Kefir used to be available however it was
made with gelatin. I tried to get Stueves over
the past 12 years to use agar-agar and they are
thinking about it now that they have a new
producer for them. But they may not until they
make more money and get back into it because
they are so much in debt. The kefir you would
buy has lactobacillus, vulgaris, and acidophilus
in their kefir. Those are all great bacteria. They
will digest similar to your own bacteria but not
the same. So if you just let the milk sit out, its
own bacteria grows its own environment which
is identical. That is what milk is all about:
preparing an infant for digestion of bacteria to
carry on proper digestion. If we got it right out
of the cow, we would never have to let it sit,
sour, because it goes right into refrigeration and
has to reach a temperature of 38 degrees at the
plants where they hold the milk. It destroys
bacteria and takes 3 days to regenerate it to get
it back into full bacteria content in order to help
us create a good digestive environment. So
those bacteria that you will create like yogurt, kefir, are good but not as good as your own body
will create by souring milk. I eat it any time and
every time except with my juice. I do not drink
any milk within about 20-30 minutes of my
juice. Otherwise I will drink milk with meat,
with anything else, soured.

Q: Do you put the milk back in the refrigerator
when it is clabbered?

A: Yes, after the third day when it is completely
solid like that if you leave it, it will completely
ferment and separate. The only thing you can
really do with it, if you do not want too much
alcohol, is not having it or make cottage cheese
with it. That means just straining the whey out
and adding some cream to it - coconut cream or
whatever cream you like with it. Then you have
cottage cheese.

Q: It is not too solid to drink after 3 days?

A: After 3 days or after the point that it is solid.

Q: So how do you drink it?

A: Shake it up until it is a little thinner, put it in a
different container or do whatever you like.

Q: Refrigeration does not kill that present bacteria?

A: No, it will not. If it did, it would melt down
again more than half a day in the refrigerator.

Q: What about soured milk?

A: You know, your body digests milk by souring
it. Nothing wrong with it. It does not putrefy
unless you cook it. When you cook anything, it
putrefies. When you let the meat rot... the
Eskimos let their meat rot, the Turks let their
meat get green before they eat it because it is
predigested. It is naturally with its own
bacteria.

Q: And they eat it raw?

A: They eat it raw. They used to eat it raw. They
do not eat it as raw anymore. Kibbeh is raw
lamb mixed with bulgur. Steak tartar. Carpaccio.
Every culture has had their raw meat specialty.

Q: When I gave her the raw goat milk (with
honey), a few hours later she complained that her
tummy hurt and then cried all night that her
hand and foot hurt her. Now, she had not hurt
them and all I could think was that she had
cramps in them.

A: Those are symptoms of allergies but they are
rarely, if ever, irreversible allergies to the raw
milk. There are 3 basic reasons those symptoms
may have occurred:

I suggest that you warm the raw milk by placing
it in a jar with a tight lid and immersing it in a
bowl of warm water until it reaches body
temperature, that you give her only 4 ounces per
day until the symptoms subside and then
increase by 1 ounce per week, and no more than
2 drops of unheated per 4 ounces of milk. I do
not know of any case that did not resolve the
temporary reactions when drinking raw milk.

Q: I really intuitively feel like she just cannot
tolerate the dairy. What are all the possible good
fats besides dairy?

A: I have never seen a case where those
symptoms occurred by eating raw butter and
raw cream which have only trace amounts of
protein and lactate (milk sugar). Raw butter
and raw cream are the most effective fats
toward reaching better health.

Q: What if you can’t eat the dairy products? I
can’t drink the raw milk.

A: What reaction do you have from the raw
milk?

Q: I get terrible headaches.

A: Have you tried to let it sit out and sour?
Maybe you just do not have the enzymes to
digest it cold and the proteins are allergic to it
because they do not digest them. They get past
the duodenum without being broken. Goats milk
does not have as much casein, that particular
protein in it is the one that is hard to break
down when you try to drink it cold.

If those undigested proteins pass through they
can cause the skin to break out.

Q: I am consuming raw goat milk but still cannot
digest cows milk.

A: In order to digest cow's milk you may be one
of the many individuals who needs to consume
it at room-temperature when enzymes and
bacteria have become active again.
Refrigeration destroys and/or makes enzymes
and bacteria dormant that would normally
provide for proper digestion.

Q: I have tried to follow your advice to lower my
milk intake to 2 portions of 1/2 cup during the
day, but I continue to experience problems related
to the milk. At times when I lie down my chest
feels so heavy that it scares me. It's a feeling like
my chest may not be able to expand enough to get
air, because of the heaviness and laboriousness.

I'm wondering if milk could be contraindicated
for me --- maybe this problem could be explained
by the fact that I am gluten intolerant (and casein
intolerant)probably causing the autoimmune
problems, insulin problems, and many more of my
symptoms, and signs shown through the iridology.
My instincts are telling me to stop drinking milk,
and maybe cream.

A: In the years when I performed laboratory tests, raw milk never produced fractured casein-
related and lactate-related molecules. The raw
milk will, however, help detoxify stored casein-
and lactate-related toxins from cooked foods
from previous diets. If your discharge is too
frightening, I suggest that you reduce milk
intake to 1/2 cup per day and have it early in the
day. You might want to abstain completely from
milk 1-2 days a week until you feel more
comfortable with your processes.

He is asking whether it is good to chug milk. No.
If you are drinking it at room temperature and it
is starting to sour, it is okay to chug it. But if you
are drinking it straight out of the refrigerator
cold and you chug it, a lot of proteins are going
to pass into your duodenum that are not
properly digested and you are going to have
some protein toxicity. You see me chugging milk
but you better believe it is milk that has been
out of the refrigerator quite a while and already
sour.

Q: Kefir. Once it sits in the bottle for a couple of
days the curds and the whey separate. Does it
become more potent to let it set for another week
or so?

What he asked was when he lets the milk sit for
a few days it separates. The solids separate
from the whey. Will it be better and stronger if
you left it longer is what he is asking. Now what
I have to ask is do you add a kefir culture to it?

Q: No.

A: You are letting the milk clabber on its own?

Q: Yes.

A: Once the milk separates, that whey turns very
alcoholic. It is not very good for most people. It
will damage digestibility. Instead of
encouraging bacteria it will destroy bacteria.
You can use that whey to make pickled foods if
you like, in place of vinegar. It is better for
people who have overly acidic systems. It is
better to use the whey as your pickler. I suggest
once that the milk solids separate from the
whey, to not drink it. Make cottage cheese.
When that happens to me, I pour it through a
gauze cloth and I get the cottage cheese out of it.
If I like a scrambled egg like taste I will take a
raw egg with an extra raw yolk and I will drink
the egg white and then the mix two egg yokes
with one egg white into the cottage cheese and it
tastes like scrambled eggs. The whey is the
liquid that is too much alcohol at that point. ...
only because I have seen that it causes a
destruction and lowering of bacteria following
within 2-5 hours within urine and also within
fecal matter within 34-36 hours afterwards. So
it does destroy bacteria and we do not want to
destroy bacteria unless you are with the health
department.

Q: If leave my milk on the counter for 3 days,
when does it change so that the liquid is bad?

A: It depends on the heat. If it is warmer, it may
do it during 2 days like in the summer when it
was up to 90 degrees. The milk would clabber
into kefir within 36-48 hours. You are supposed
to catch it before it goes.

Q: Is that before the thick feeling?

A: No, at the thick feeling is fine. Then it will go
into yogurt – sour. Then after that it goes right
into the separation. When you see the different
color on both ends – that is when there is
separation.

Q: What about putting the honey in the milk?

You always put it in before because blending
will destroy the bacteria. You blend it in there
and then shake it up and then let it sit.

Q: How about if you spoon a little in your mouth
and then take it in?

A: That is fine.

We were talking about letting the milk sit out.
And somebody asked about putting honey in the
milk. Can you do that before or after blending it
with the milk? My response was as soon as you
get the milk, blend it with the honey if you are
going to let it sit out. Because if you start
blending it with the honey before you drink it
you are going to alter and oxidize some of the bacteria and oxidization destroys some of the
bacteria. You want the full potential of the
bacteria; do not blend it before you let it solidify.

I forgot to mention your burning. Milk often
causes chemicals to be removed from the tissues
and dumped into stomach or intestines. If the
chemicals are abrasive, or have been stored with
bile, they are caustic and most often will cause
burning and/or stinging followed by numbness
until cells regenerate. But meat is needed for
cellular regeneration.

Q: Lactose intolerance – when you do get
cramping do you have any ideas?

That all depends on the individual. Do you mean
cramping from the raw milk? Have you tried it?
Sometimes when I was getting over my
problems - like my liver poisoning from the
poison mushroom - if I mixed eggs with milk, I
got instant cramping and gas. I could not stand
it. I had to have milk separately and egg
separately. I could not mix egg and honey
together. I would have the same reaction and
that lasted up until 2 years ago. So I have not
been able to have a smoothie with honey like
everybody else until the last 2 years. So you just
have to find your way. Like I showed you I always leave my milk out so it ferments but not
so it is full of alcohol. I was wondering if there is
there anyone else here who have problems with
their large or small intestines? Is there anyone
here besides me who has had those experiences.
Anyone today with stomach disorders?

Q: I don't understand how he can not be allergic
to raw dairy.

A: Most people require the manufacture of very
little lactase to digest raw milk. An abundance is
necessary to digest the cauterized lactate in
pasteurized milk. Many people cannot
manufacture much lactase.

Q: Many people on this diet regularly complain
on e-groups about the raw-dairy aspect of the
diet. I, for example, improved slowly on the
Primal Diet for 4 months, and then stopped
improving. I then got rid of all the raw-dairy in
my diet, while sticking 100% to the rest of the
high-fat diet, and I no longer have noticeable
detox reactions any more, and my health has
improved considerably ever since. I can only say
that dairy, as it's not a Paleolithic food, is a
poison, raw or pasteurized.

A: It is a misconception that dairy is not a
Paleolithic food. There are many primitive
tribes who eat raw dairy and thrive excellently
on it. The lives of the Fulani, Maasai and

Samburu discount that dairy is evil. The
American Indians used milk to draw poisons to
the stomach after poisonous bites. As I stated in
my book, butter has been the greatest food to
help people stabilize, recover and strengthen.

Yes, raw milk causes more detoxification
because it allows the body to dump vast
toxins/poisons - especially from the gallbladder,
spleen, pancreas and liver - into the stomach
and intestines. That is beneficial.

How can you be on a high-fat diet without butter
or cream? Olive oil and flax are certainly not
Paleolithic foods. No primitive tribes lives on
pressed oils except for coconut.

The Paleo rhetoric that eating raw dairy in all
their forms had the same effect on the body and
mind as taking drugs, has no scientific basis. My
lab tests 10 years ago showed that the fats that
were chelated to chemical residues from
pesticides had very little indications of digestive
activity. The lab technician was able to confirm
that 98% of those chemicals discharged in the
feces without absorption in the body. Whereas,
the animals who ate pasteurized dairy and meat
absorbed 95% of the chemical residues, only
passing 5% in the feces.

Continuing to consume raw butter and
minimizing milk and cream intake may serve
your health better.

Thank you for your comments regarding milk.
However, my documented experience in my
book WE WANT TO LIVE proves that raw milk
tremendously increases health and helps
eliminate disease. In fact, I eliminated my blood
and bone cancers, my arthritis, diabetes and 3
other incurable diseases by daily ingesting raw
dairy products. The argument that no other
animal drinks milk after weaning is elementary.
The mother simply does not allow her young to
continue. Place a bowl of milk down for them
and they will continue to drink it.

I have seen that raw dairy aids the body in toxic
elimination and soothes the systems while
detoxifying. If we weren't so ill, we could
probably do without it. The research that you
have done regarded pasteurized and/or
processed milk, not raw. The Maasai tribe in Africa has lived for thousands of years on raw
milk, raw blood and raw meat, almost
exclusively, and until 20 years ago, before white
man introduced garbage food, as the healthiest,
happiest (equal to the Eskimo 150 years ago),
most intelligent and tallest race in the world.
They drink raw milk their entire lives and they
have none of the diseases that you cite that milk
causes. Again, it is processed milk that is the
problem, as in all food.

Q: I have never heard of this before, and I don't
believe it is true, yet I would love to know what
your research has to counter this idea that
protein in cow's milk, even raw milk, not being
good for human consumption. Apparently there
is a lot of research that supports this.

A: Mr. Cales does not seem to have any
experience to support his conclusions and
points to other people's research. However, if
you observe the Fulani tribes in Africa, 90% of
their diet is milk. The Maasai tribe consumes
milk as 30-50% of their diet. Neither suffers
disease and both are incredibly healthy and
peaceful. The argument that milk is for infants
only is like arguing that nectar is for plants only
and bees have not business eating it. Certainly,
then, humans should avoid it! That logic seems
sub-academic. The Fulani tribe eat approximately 90% raw dairy. We nor they had
to evolve to drink raw milk. All mammals were
born to drink raw milk. The assumptions and
conclusions above regarding evolving to drink
raw milk are basically ludicrous. Some people
simply decided to continue drinking raw milk
beyond infanthood such as the Fulani and
Maasai, and me.

Q: Do you know how to make raw kefir? If not,
any ideas on who might?

A: The best cultured milk for you would be to
place 1 tsp. of your spittle in a quart of raw milk
and let it stand for 2 ½ - 3 days at room
temperature. It is a good idea to gently turn the
bottle upside down a few times a day to mix the
cream into the milk. After it clabbers, refrigerate
it, or drink it all that day. You do not have to use
spittle for the milk to turn kefir and clabber but
it is an old homeopathic remedy and works
wonderfully to build enzymes and bacteria
perfectly for whomever the spittle belonged.
Enjoy! Some information, such as spittle to
clabber milk, is for the seasoned highly
enthusiastic raw fooder like yourself. Others
may judge you or may be turned off. My
suggestion is that you be discreet with some of what you know.

Excessive mucous production, congestion and
headaches are not symptoms of milk allergies
when raw milk is consumed. It is an indication
that toxic milk protein and sugar - stored in the
body from having eaten pasteurized milk
products - are detoxifying from tissues and
discharging through the mucous membranes.

Milk causes poisons to detoxify, mainly to be
drawn into the blood and dumped in to the
stomach. That sometimes results in nausea,
high blood-pressure and headaches but those
symptoms are not allergies to raw milk. When
available, Native Americans drank milk to draw
poisonous snake or insect fluids from bites to
the stomach where it was neutralized by
hydrochloric acids produced by the stomach. If
you choose not to tolerate the detoxification that
raw milk affords, I suggest you do not drink it.

Q: Maybe I should learn how to make my own raw
butter, huh?

A: I do it sometimes.
Step 1, I have prepared a pint of ice water,
although not frozen, that I use in Step 4.
Step 2, I blend the cream in a jar with a little less
room for the cream to swell to its normal
volume, and blend past the point of whipped to
when I can see swirl patterns of alternating
liquid and butter. I continue to let it blend at this
point for about 30 seconds.
Step 3, I drain the whey from the butter.
Step 4, I place the butter in a larger jar and pour
the ice water into the jar with the butter and
blend for only 5 seconds.
Step 4, I drain the ice water from the butter and
with a spoon I press out any excess water.

Q: I think I read in "Healing with Whole Foods" by
Paul Pitchford that milk should be ingested
separately from meat. Do you believe this is true?
Why or why not?

A: They are both acid foods, usually from the
same animal. Only in individuals with extreme
digestive difficulties have I experienced a
problem with mixing RAW milk and meat. To
those digestively challenged individuals there
are many foods that I suggest they not mix.
Cooked milk and meat is another issue.

Q: In the article I sent you, a case is being made
for the health value of organic butter (even if not
raw).

A: True, it is better than the hydrogenated fats
but still contains lipid peroxides and destroyed
vitamins, enzymes and cauterized minerals. It
will not prevent degenerative tissue as raw will.

Q. On my specific program, am I allowed to have
colostrum? If so, then when in relation to my
program, how much and with what other food, if
any?

A: Yes. In place of milk. I recommend only one
cup per day. The colostrum should be consumed
after it reaches room temperature. If drinking
colostrum within an hour after eating a meal,
the meal that precedes you drinking colostrum
should be meat.

Q: I read that Bovine Colostrum has pathogens
and E. coli antibodies That is it weakens them
I'm a bit confused about it. Does it mean we
should not drink Colostrum? Or are they
misinterpreting the research?

A: It means that certain types of bacteria are unable to grow in the colostrum. It does not
mean that they eradicate them from the body;
they do not.

Colostrum provides nutrients for calves to
develop digestion. If you have faulty digestion, 1
cup per day would be helpful. If not, 2-4 cups
per week when available.

In powdered form, colostrum is unstable protein
and does not promote stable cellular
reproduction.

Q: Please choose which of these you prefer: Colby,
sharp cheddar, mild cheddar, smoked cheddar.

A: The raw no-salt-added cheeses in the U.S.
only come in Low-Sodium Cheddar,
Low-Sodium Monterey, and Low-Sodium
Muenster. Smoked cheeses are not raw and
cause many people, including me, headaches. If
you have a source that supplies no-salt cheese
with the flavors I would like. [For an update,
contact Amish farmers listed in Primal Diet ™
Raw Foods List 2020 to find the flavors they
now offer.]

Those who have had the benefit of Claravale,
even though illegal by county statue, know its
value to make detoxification and coping with life
much more relaxing. Those who have not been
without it since starting the diet will learn its
value as they continue without it. Yes, the
argument that cow's milk is for baby cows has
been heralded for centuries by some people.
Life on this planet is a process of one life-form
consuming another life form. We may scavenge
from any food chain and usually do okay with it.
I tried for years at time, one period lasted nearly
6 1/2 years, to do without fresh dairy products.
Without them I lived and gained in health
because the foods I consumed were raw,
however, I have always done much better with
fresh raw milk products than without. While
working with clients during those fresh-raw-
dairy-free periods, it was much more difficult to balance my patients', and my bodily well-being.
Raw dairy makes most bodies function much
better. Raw dairy is a wonderful absorber and
chelator of poisons. The American Indians used
it to absorb snake poison into the stomach, and
then vomited to expel it. The Maasai and
Samburu drink it as their mainstay and they are
considered to be the healthiest, happiest,
smartest and strongest tribes on Earth. Your
argument that cow's milk is for calves seems one
dimensional and academic. When an individual
reaches their optimal state in 40 years after
eating a perfect diet, then dairy may not be as
necessary. However, for now I view humans as
not only infants but as toxic infants who would
benefit greatly from the attributes of nature's
simplest and easiest-to-digest food on earth:
raw milk; until they are well. We will see what
is necessary then. Yet, again, the Maasai and
Samburu go to their graves drinking raw milk
daily.

Q: Is it possible to do this without dairy?

Yes, but won’t be as calm or happy ... might
have a tendency towards irritability. I tried to
do it without dairy for 6 years. Milk draws
poisons out of the system and dumps it into the
stomach; prevents it from going into the
lymphatic system or tissues or glands. No other
fat is as useful as the butter in recovering.

Butter has a tendency to mold after 3 months. I
make blue cheese that way. I let the butter go to
6 months. I have to have air in the container or
it won’t become blue cheese. I remove half the
butter, put the lid back on with a crack in it and
put it back in the refrigerator and let it sit 3 to 6
months. I’ll have it with apple.

Q: If you drink the milk cold, there is less
bacteria?

A: I don’t do that. I let it sit at least 10 hours,
preferable over night for 24 hours in a dark
cupboard so that the light doesn’t alter the fat
into a bitter substance. If you put the milk back
into the fridge after it’s been out it will go
dormant again. When you drink it cold,
undigested protein and lactate (milk sugar) are
going to pass into your blood undigested and
you’ll have toxins and bloating, less energy,
interferes with digestion. If you’re going
through menopause, its worse because if it will
give you a boost of heat. It takes a couple hours
to get to room temperature then time to
multiply the bacteria.

Q: If raw milk is not available is it okay to use
pasteurized kefir or yogurt?

A: No. Use coconuts and drink the milk out of
them. Juice the coconut meat. You can mix the
coconut milk with the coconut cream and it’s a
good substitute. It has been fed to orphan
infants in South America with no signs of
abnormalities – going for over 2000 years. So
that’s your best substitute. With anything
pasteurized, you’re dealing with cauterized
minerals, no ionization involved so it causes
osteoporosis, diabetes. See the report in Dr.
Douglass’ milk book. Pasteurized milk causes a
lot of diseases.

Q: I wanted to elaborate on our discussion about
the kids in PA getting sick, but we were cut off.

A: The issue with accepting the reports that the
kids all drank the raw milk and then got sick is
something that can be researched further. What
else did they all eat or drink that day? They
didn't just have raw milk. It is assumed by the
health officials that it was the raw milk that
caused the GI [gastrointestinal] distress. How
can we know for sure? By interviewing the
people who went on that field trip to get the
details of the day without bias.

I have real doubt that the raw milk was the
culprit.

A: After having dealt with many health
departments, including the CDC, I learned that rarely, unless forced, does anyone contradict the
findings of health officials and supervising
employees. They keep their mouths closed and
fear for their jobs/livelihood.

After one of the Milk-Commission-meetings, one
of the health-department employees
approached me outside the building where no
one else from the commission-meeting could be
seen. He spoke very softly and told me that he
believed that raw milk is better and not harmful
even if not clean. He told me in almost a whisper
that he had been a health official in his native
country and never had a problem with
unpasteurized unclean raw milk. He also said
that he had to do what he was told and that all
health-department employees had to sign a
contract that they could not speak against any
decision or policy except if it were political.

In the 80's, a little girl died while swimming.
Autopsy proved that she died of drowning. The
autopsy-report stated that she had salmonella in
her stomach. The Chief of the California State
Dept of Health, Dr. Werner, seized the
opportunity to see if the child drank raw milk. It
was supposedly established by interview with
the mother that the family drank Alta Dena raw
milk. The health official told her that if they had
drunk raw milk that she could sue Alta Dena for the death of her daughter and that the health-
department would testify in her behalf. During
trial, she was unable to say where she purchased
raw milk even though she claimed her family
regularly drank it until her daughter was killed
by the raw milk. It was apparent that the health-
department, led by its official, had conspired
against Alta Dena's raw milk and had suborned
perjury from the woman. No charges were ever
filed against the health-department official
because he was protected by state-law
immunity.

If anyone is going to parrot anything that health-
departments conclude, the facts should be
diligently scrutinized and proved but never
accepted on face value. As any scientist does, he
not only proves that something is correct, he
does everything possible do disprove it.

I spent 5 days in jail for contempt of court in 1972. I was transported to Wayside minimum
security prison where, at that time, prisoners
milked the cows and churned the butter. They
were not careful; dirt and fecal matter often
entered it. If hair floated at the top, they
scooped it out with a strainer. All prisoners
were served raw milk and raw butter. No one
got sick, no one feared any sickness from it. I
must assume that if there had been a problem, it would have been stopped. It was not.

Q : Now the other question I wanted to ask was
about the eggs. Now the Lilly eggs are the only
ones that are pasture feed?

A: They are the only pasture fed.

Q: Okay they are never refrigerated?

A: They are never refrigerated.

Q: If I buy the ones at the grocery store you just
take them out the refrigerator?

A: Yes.

Q: Will I lose anything?

A: You will lose a little bit but they will regain a
little after you let them sit. If you eat them right
away it takes 24-48 hours to build up the
bacteria up again. The only requirement in LA
County and the state of California is that they
refrigerate them from the packing house to the
store.

Q: And Lilly’s too?

A: No, Lilly does not go through that network. It
is sold at farmers markets so it does not go
through that. But for the regular it goes from the
packing house to the stores the first time they
are refrigerated. So if you know when they get
the eggs in, then you get there as soon as
possible.

Q: What about the variety of colors?

A: That is the chicken itself.

Q: What about the green ones? They are a lot
more expensive.

A: They are exotic chickens.

Q: Not one is better than another?

A: No.

Q: Do you eat the green eggs?

A: Yes.

Q: Why are fertile eggs better than non-fertile
ones?

A: ... more enzymes and growth-hormones. The
most important factor when buying eggs is that
they are free-range. All fertile eggs are free-
range.

Q: What is your opinion of commercially sold
eggs...are they safe to eat raw?

A: No. Some use hormones and all use
antibiotics in the feed. My experiments have
shown that eating eggs produced by hens fed
antibiotics increase swelling, destroy digestive
bacteria and reduce enzymes.

Q: How about "organic eggs" also sold by some
supermarkets (A&P in the NJ area)?

A: Organic eggs means that they have not been
fed antibiotics or chemically produced feed. My
concern becomes: do they get exercise? If they
also say "free-range" they will be very good eggs.

Q: My question is about egg shells. Should we put
them in with our smoothie?

No. In the experiments I have done with egg
shells, it takes a gizzard to break them down.
We do not do it well. I found a lot of cellular
bleeding and a lot more blood in the stools when
eating egg shells. Dogs have a hydrochloric acid
which can melt it down. Dogs do okay with eggs
but we do not. There are some tribes that can
do it but they take lemon or lime and dissolve it
first but I have even found that dissolving the
egg shells still creates lacerations in the
intestines. If you want to put extra minerals in
your food, grow some plants, let’s say some
celery or parsley, put lots of egg shells in you
compost and put that in there and it will put
concentrated minerals to your vegetable juice.

Q: Why do you not refrigerate your eggs?

A: Because you will destroy the vitamins and
enzymes in your eggs and you will assimilate
and absorb less and less protein. When you
leave them out they grow bacteria in them. I
will leave some out in the sun and rot them till
they are old and stinky. They taste like a rotten
Easter egg. It doesn’t hurt at all but the smell is
horrendous. But you know the Chinese have the
century old egg which they rot from 5 to 25
years. They rot them buried in clay. They can
be from anywhere from $25-$100-$1000 an egg.
Old Chinese men who are 80-90 years old will
pay $ 1,000 for black eggs that are rotten to the
core and they will go out and screw 30 times in a
night for up to 5-6 months. It is worth it for
them.

Q: We now know why you eat those eggs.

A: It leads to vitality, to good feeling. All the
good stuff. ...

Q: How did you find all this out?

A: ... experimentation and laboratory tests.

Q: I am curious of how you maintain your eggs. I
assume you don't keep them in a refrigerator and
if so how long will they last in a normal
environment?

A: I mentioned them in my books. Raw eggs do
not spoil, they become bacterial rich. I have
kept them for up to 6 months and eaten them
stinking and black. Bacterial-rich eggs are
prized food in China.

Q: I have read that bought eggs create biotin.

A: In my book there is a mis-print. A spell
checker went through and changed avidin to
albumin. So it is the avidin that binds with the
biotin which only happens in a chemistry lab
and it does not happen in the body.

Q: Are you saying that it does not happen in the
body?

A: It does not..

Q: People who are saying that are saying that
because...

A: It happens in a laboratory but it does not
happen in a human body. You use a lot of biotin
in the process of changing over biocarbons in the body. So when you get raw eggs you are
going to use that biotin in it to change over, and
you are going to find avidin present in that
complex, but it is not a deprivation but a
utilization to transport biocarbons. I mentioned
that in the book. Just remember when you get to
that part that talks about albumin it is supposed
to be avidin.

I have been arguing with Sally Fallon of the
Weston Price Foundation, over the suitability of
eating whole raw eggs. She maintains that you
should eat only the yolk. I believe (based on
years of experience) that the best way to eat raw
eggs is whole, with the yolks unbroken & intact.

Many people rely on conclusions drawn from
past research. I mentioned the union of biotin
and avidin in my first book but the spell-checker
changed "avidin" to "albumin". The union of the
two appears to rid the body of biocarbons. The
human body has an immense quantity of
biocarbons from cooked-food diets and pollution. I have seen respiratory diseases
benefited with mass consumption of eggs,
exclusive of other food. In my second book, I
mentioned the elderly women who suffered
with 4th-stage emphysema, alive by machinery
and bedridden, eat 33 eggs a day for two days
and was on her feet and ready to take on the
world again. My experience has proved to me
that the negative conclusions about raw eggs are
flawed. My experience proved to me that it is
healthier to have less biocarbons and not worry
about the union of biotin and avidin. Plenty of
biotin can be consumed in other food on a raw
diet. It is eating cooked food that causes the
immense deficiencies. It is my conclusion that it
is better to eat plenty of health-promoting raw
eggs and avoid cooked food than to eat cooked
food and avoid raw eggs.

I explained my lab tests with animals that
showed that eating the yolk without the white,
or the white without the yolk caused major
imbalances. If anyone were to redo my tests,
they would probably draw the same conclusions
as I did. But people seem to be satisfied with
borrowed conclusions that the biotin-avidin
union and enzyme inhibitors are harmful. If it
were, my clients and I would be in big trouble
because most of us eat many.

She goes on and on about how avidin binds with
biotin, blocking its absorption, how raw egg
white contains "enzyme inhibitors", according to
Edward Howell's "Enzyme Nutrition" (which I
have read). Howell claims that eating large
amounts of enzyme inhibitors results in an
enlarged pancreas, as well as accelerated aging
and degeneration.

The enzyme inhibitors in eggs are easily
neutralized by hydrochloric acid. A person
would have to eat 20-30 eggs a day and almost
no other food for 8-9 months to cause a
potential problem in some people. The only
seemingly negative symptoms I witnessed with
a diet of mostly raw eggs were with people
suffering spinal, dental and joint problems. It
increased swelling and noticeable mineral
deficiencies that were easily corrected by adding
cultured milk products, including raw cheese
with raw butter and some bee pollen.

I think that the problem arises when eggs are
homogenized (blended, stirred, mixed, and so
forth). I have experimented for months eating
raw yolks, whole blended eggs & whole eggs
with yolks intact. I noticed that energy, mood &
healing were always best with the unblended
eggs.

Eggs oxidize easily if blended with a non-fluid
food. However, many people's digestive systems
are unable to easily digest cold low bacterial
milk that they blend with eggs, which can make
the eggs harder to digest.

Q: What is your response to Edward Howells
"enzyme inhibitor in raw egg white" theory?

A: My belief is that breaking the yolk and mixing
it with the white reduces the value of the protein
significantly (49% according to a study
comparing raw and cooked eggs). I also believe
that avidin can only bind with biotin in the yolk
if the yolk is broken by blending or stirring it.

As I stated above, I have found no harmful
symptoms as a result of those enzyme inhibitors
in human or other animals. In the tests that I
supervised, feeding the yolk and the white
separately resulted in high levels of biocarbons
in animals blood, urine and sometimes feces,
and appetites were more grossly affected than
those that ate yolks and whites together.

Digestibility of Cooked and Raw Egg Protein
in Humans

Homogenization creates another problem. The
fractured fat molecules coat many of the nutrients in eggs and cause them to be
undigested and cellularly unabsorbable.

Q: How would you respond to Mrs. Fallon, and
others who naively believe that raw egg yolks are
healthier than whole (unblended) eggs? Your
first book addresses the avidin-biotin issue, but
not the enzyme inhibitors in raw egg white.

A: I have observed that humans, racoons, crows,
dogs, hawks and owls have benefited greatly
from a high intake of eggs, whites consumed
with yolks, and other food were consumed in the
diet. Theorizing that something is bad does not
hold weight no matter how strong the argument
if, empirically, reality does not repeatedly and
consistently manifest the theory in a large
number of people.

Q: You mentioned in your lecture about eating a
stick of butter a day?

No, I eat two sticks of butter a day unless I have
raw cream. If I have raw cream I may eat 16 oz
of raw cream and eat no butter.

Q: Well, I did macrobiotics before.

Q: I did macrobiotics for a year and a half.

Q: My impression of it was that it was too much
butter and that it will eventually cause, in women,
ovarian cysts and clogging.

A: There is no way it could do that unless you
cook it. It has to be raw. I am talking about raw
butter that stays soluble and malleable, fluid at
body temperature. Once you heat it to pasteurization temperature, it never exchanges
ions and it will dry out and harden in the body.

Q: I thought raw butter looked like regular
butter.

A: It does, except at body temperature it melts.
At 80 degrees it will get soft and melt. If you
have been a macrobiotic for a while you are
going to have a problem with any diet change. ...

Q: If we can not get raw butter can we use olive
oil?

A: Oils, no matter what they are, are mainly
solvents. They will break down toxicity in your
body, degenerative tissue and scar tissue. They
will break it down. They will not lubricate you
and protect you and make you strong. There
was a Russian general that wrote in his journal
in WW II, “As long as my men were able to eat
the dairy, (it was only raw then,) their hair and
skin stayed supple and resilient. As soon as we
had to resort to olive oil and other pressed oils,
their skin and hair dried out within 3 months.”
They are great oils to clean out your system but
remember they are remedial. They are
medicines. They are not to be consumed too
much at a time.

Q: Is there a correlation between fat deficiency
and paranoia?

A: Yes. If cells do not have a protective coating
that is mainly fat-based, the entire body will feel
vulnerable and threatened, even with normal
simple living.

The concept of fat from the detoxification
obviously pasteurized butter even if it is organic
it is still a toxic solvent ... lots of lipid peroxides.

Q: When one can not get access to raw butter is
there an order of preference to the most favorable
of the raw fats.

A: Coconut cream.

Q: ... over animal fats?

A: No, you should have both - whether it is
cheese, milk or the cream off the top of the milk.
You should have it all but coconut cream will be
your supplement because it is the only fat that I
know that can do what the butter does – that is
getting deep into the tissues, deep into the
lymph system, the joints, the bones.

You have to run the coconut meat through the
juicer. If you eat the pulp, it will turn almost
every bit of it into a solvent. For some reason
that pulp contains enzymatic reactions. If you
take that dry pulp after you have juiced it and
rub it into your hands, your hands will get dry
like you have rubbed dirt and clay in it... solid
dry. But if you take coconut cream put it on
your hands it will not do that. So if you eat the
whole coconut it is more likely to dry you out
and cause a solvent reaction with the fats once it
has leaches them. So if you take the coconut
meat and run it through a juicer and get the
coconut cream out if it, that is what you are
after.

Q: Without the water?

A: You can mix the coconut water in the milk.

Q: Is coconut cream good to put on your body – to
just put it on it?

A: Put it on it. It is not a good thing to put on it
very often unless you live in the sunshine. If you
live in the sunshine, coconut cream is great for
the skin. Otherwise it will smother it like honey
will.

Q: What about coconut oils like you get in the
health food store?

A: There is no coconut oil that is healthy. They
heat it at high temperatures and they render it.
That means they boil it and press it. [Aajonus
later helped develop a truly unheated coconut
oil product that uses an 8 hour ferment process
that can be ordered at this website:
[http://www.thaiorganiclife.com/product/virgin](http://www.thaiorganiclife.com/product/virgin-coconut-oil-pure-raw/ .]

Kokonut Pacific operates out of Canberra,
Australia - not Malaysia. Their oil is dried
"between 45°C (110°F) and 60°C (130°F)
immediately before pressing." The workers test
the dryness with bare hands, while the meat is in
the dryer. David Wolfe has tested coconut meat
and found enzymes are not damaged until 170°F
dry-heat. Only a WET-HEAT of 118F will damage
enzymes, in general. DRY-HEAT must be 150F or
more. In that case, the Kokonut Pacific oil is well
within safe limits. (It's 110-130, not 110-155.)

I have contacted Quality First, which makes the
oil from India, inquiring about whether the meat
is in fact roasted prior to the wet-milling and cold
centrifugal extraction. All of their published
information says it is NOT roasted or heated in
any way - before, during, or after extraction. Are you sure you're talking about same company?
Unless you have tested the oil for enzymes, and
studied the effect of eating it, how can you be so
sure it is not in fact a healthy raw fat?

I asked the company: Is the coconut heated when
producing DME [a brand name] Oil?

The company replied: Our process DOES involve
heat in the sense that we semi-dry the raw
material before pressing out the oil. This heating
process is gentle in that the material is constantly
turned and tossed in the air to speed up the
drying process. This stage takes about 30 to 45
minutes (depending on the humidity,
temperature, breeze etc). The "chef" in the team
of 3 to 5 family workers tests the material (that is
ready for pressing) by squeezing it in her (usually
it is a female) hand. Thus it is not subjected to the
high temperatures of most other oil extraction
systems. It is usually between 45°C (110°F) and
60°C (130°F) immediately before pressing. This is
"cold" by oil standards.

Virgin Oil de Coco-CrèmeT:
Literally 'untouched oil' extracted from coconut
milk. Raw material for oil recovery is high grade
fresh coconut meat (not copra). Oil Extraction achieved via 'coconut wet-milling' process
which uses cold pressing to obtain an emulsion
and centrifugation to separate oil from water
content. At no stage in the entire process from
pressing to purification are heat or chemical
treatments used.

Wet Milling' Process:
A technology designed to produce a fresh pure
oil on a large scale while preserving all of its
natural functionality. Several methods have
been proposed and so far only one, 'coconut
wet-milling' has been developed for large scale
production. Wet process technology extracts oil
by mechanical means only; without high
temperature, chemical, or enzymatic treatment.
It is a natural process, as the physical or
chemical characteristics of the coconut oil is not
altered in any way. The result is a high quality,
unrefined virgin oil which conserves all of the
functional qualities of coconut oil. The
disadvantage to the wet process is that the yield
tends to be lower than that of other methods
like solvent extraction. This, along with the need
to use high quality raw materials, translates into
a higher product cost.

Visual: White solid / Colourless and crystal clear when melted

Visual: Melts evenly and more easily than RBD coconut oil. [RBD coconut oil is a type of coconut oil that is refined, bleached and deodorized.]

Olfactory: Light, fresh coconut aroma (not an added scent)

Taste: Natural unprocessed sweet (NOT
ROASTED) Coconut taste

Touch: Melts very easily on touch

Touch: Quick absorption

Touch: No oily after - feel

Touch: Very light viscosity (lighter than
"fractionated" oil)

A: My research returned from the plant was that
in India they heat the meat before juicing
between 150-210F. The dryer in Malaysia heats
the meat between 118- 155F.

I worked with mainly coconut as my fat for
almost 6 years. In my experience coconut
heated above 96F caused indigestion and acid-
reflux in several clients. I, too, was that
sensitive. Several experienced acne only if the
coconut was heated at 105F or above. It is a
belief, not fact, that coconut is not altered until
temperatures above 170F. The visual
properties may seem unaffected however, the
results achieved prove that destructive
alteration occurs at a much lower temperatures.

For your reference: raw cream from cows is
similar. The Dutch chemist, Willem J. Van at
Oregon State College, confirmed the Wulzen
findings that pasteurized dairy creates
calcification and stiffness. He found that guinea
pigs with calcification of the tissues could be
relieved with raw cream but not so with heated
cream. The active factor is transmuted and
rendered ineffective by even low heat. (The Milk
Book; Dr. William Campbell Douglass, Jr., MD;
1994.)

Cod liver oil is an animal product. It is not a
pressed oil. It is an extracted oil but not a
pressed oil, not from vegetation or fruit. It is
actually an animal fat. And it is wonderful
where ever you can get it. But you have to talk
to the chemist wherever it is made and make
sure they extract it at no higher than 82 degrees
and they can not use a solvent to do it.

Q: Do you know of a brand that they do it that
way?

A: Not anymore. I have not investigated because
I do not use supplements any more. It is better
to just go out and get the fish and have the
protein with the fat.

Q: Bob Marshall might have it?

A: But I would still check into it. Check with the
chemist.

Oil will not work it dries out the tissues.

90% of oils are made into solvents and that is
for detoxification to break down fats, congestion
and degenerative tissue. It is a drying
compound. Pressed oils do not lubricate the
body. The byproduct of it is almost identical to
turpentine and it is just as toxic so it can create
low grade nausea and sometimes a little
depression. It destroys virus and bacteria and
they are the quick way to get ride of toxicity. So
eating rotten meats...

Peanut oil seems to work with the glands a little
bit better including sexual – the Africans use it
as an aphrodisiac. If you have it in your nut mix
it will stimulate your sexuality eventually if you
have enough of it. 2x’s a week will stimulate
that.

The olive oil is more scar tissue oriented and
helps dissolve it.

The flax oil (very unstable) is more related to
the intestines and glands

You should always have the oils with other
meats – you can have a solvent in there but if
you do not have a good fat along with it, it will
cause you to be irritable, dry or have flaky skin.
It is better to have it with milk afterwards. I
enjoy the nut mixes with chicken and turkey,
sometimes with meat – not so much with fish.

Q: How much olive oil do you put in your meat?

A: Well, when I am detoxing heavily like this I do
not add to it. I have been staying away from
olive oil for a whole month since I have been
detoxing but normally I have ½ cup a week. ½ a
cup means 8 tbsp of olive oil. So I might have 2-
4 tbsp of olive oil with one meat meal. But I
usually have more at one meal so you not always
making solvents.

Q: I heard that hemp oil is supposed to be really
good?

A: Hemp oil can not be pressed under 176
degrees. Everybody is trying to jack up a new
product. It does not work.

Q: Do you know anything about palm oil? I was
reading about it last night in a book about
coconut oil. It said they have many of the same
benefits as coco oil but isn't generally
commercially available and it didn't go further
than that.

I know palm oil is used in cooking in the area of
Africa I am going to. I don't know how they
prepare the oil before they cook with it, if it is
heated. I am not even sure if it can be eaten raw.
I wondered if you knew anything about it. Maybe
it is an interesting new raw fat?

A: Tree oil is always sap. Sap is a very difficult
fat to digest and requires a long intestinal track,
or gizzard, or special liver enzymes, such as in
herbivores and birds. I have seen that eating
raw, unheated maple syrup (sap from maple trees) causes loss of appetite, indigestion and
severe sugar reactions.

Propolis is tree sap from various trees. It is
difficult to dissolve and digest but a little can be
beneficial. The bees use it to ward-off mites,
ants and other creatures that are affected by sap
vapors.

The sesame oil can not be pressed under 167
degrees. And they usually do it at 178 and that
is much too high. Even the Spectrum oil. The
only oil that is under 96 degrees is the olive and
the peanut. (Now even the peanut oil is being
heated up to 125 degrees.) Anytime you do not
see it light yellow, the heat is too high.
Whenever you see the peanut oil darker than
when it’s an amber color, it’s too hot. If it is
yellow it’s fine.

Q: ... and the flax seed oil?

A: It’s fine. It’s never heated above 92 degrees.

Normally, fat digests slower than any other food
except whole vegetation. Too-slow digestion of
fat indicates a sluggish and/or impaired liver.
Too much fat consumed without enough meat
causes impaired fat digestion, assimilation and
utilization, sluggish lymphatic, blood and
neurological systems - unless a lot of exercise is
performed.

Q: Why do they believe that greater quantities of
fat cells equal greater toxicity? The Primal Diet™
point of view is that the toxins are bound and held
in the fat, right? And then released in a benign
way over time?

Q: Yes, fats bind with toxins. If fats are clean and
unadulterated, meaning raw, when eaten, most
toxins that are bound in animal fat will not be
released into the human body. Mostly it will
remain bound in the fat and pass through the
digestive system unabsorbed, unless an
individual has been starving. Fats that are
cooked are fractionated without cellular
selection, losing their ability to bind with toxins.
Toxins are released into the body of the person
eating the cooked fat plus the toxins formed
from the cooked fat. These toxins may be
re-bound by fats processed in humans eating them and stored as cellulite. If enough clean fat
is eaten and very little toxins are introduced by
food and environment, over time the body will
dissolve the cellulite and remove it and the
toxins bound in it.

Q: As for refrigeration, my butter goes sour in a
couple of weeks in the refrigerator. I do rinse the
butter when making it.

Rinse it with very, very cold water and it will
remove the lactose that causes souring. The
souring simply indicates that the nutrients in the
butter are readily available, that is, predigested.

In my travels to the Pacific islands among the
natives, I never found a method of extracting
coconut butter/oil that prevented the butter/oil
from fermenting and souring within 5 days at
room temperature.

In 1997, I contacted several companies that
claimed to sell "Raw" coconut oil/butter, or
labeled cold-pressed that did not ferment or
sour. It was very similar in body and texture to
Crisco. I insisted that their sources supply me
with written statements of the entire process
and that the coconut never meets unnatural
temperatures above 96 degrees F. After 3
months and many calls, I was told that the
coconut butter was rendered. That is, the
coconut is first cold-pressed completely raw,
then the pulp is immersed in water and heated
to as high as boiling temperatures, cooled and re-cold-pressed. This is done up to 15 re-
pressings. Therefore, the coconut butter/oil was
not truly cold-pressed or raw.

I worked with mainly coconut as my fat for
almost 6 years. In my experience coconut heated
above 96F caused indigestion and acid-reflux in
several clients. I, too, was that sensitive. Several
experienced acne only if the coconut was heated
at 105F or above. It is a belief, not fact, that
coconut is not altered until temperatures above
170F. The visual properties may seem
unaffected however, the results achieved prove
that destructive alteration occurs at a much
lower temperatures. [As mentioned earlier,
Aajonus later recommended coconut oil from
this company:
[http://www.thaiorganiclife.com/product/virgin](http://www.thaiorganiclife.com/product/virgin-coconut-oil-pure-raw/ .]

There are no brands of cod liver oil that are not
solvent-extracted and/or purified and/or heat-
treated. It is best to eat fish.

Flax seeds are pretty much indigestible. The oil,
when pressed and consumed, is mainly
used by the body as a solvent and will dry all
body systems. Flax seeds are a rich source of
omega-3 oils.

I eat the one with the most mercury, swordfish.
When they eat the plankton it is full of mercury.
We are not talking about PCB. [A
polychlorinated biphenyl is an organic chlorine
compound]. We are talking about mercury that
naturally exists in nature. When the plankton
are high in it, it is a natural substance. The
swordfish can do lots of things because the
mercury is not contaminated. When you cook it,
you contaminate it. When you eat it raw you get
it healthy – it is bioactivity charged within
tissue.

Q: Is that the best fish that is out there?

A: No, it is whatever appeals to you. It is just
that I like swordfish the best.

There is organic mercury, inorganic mercury and vapor mercury that crystallizes to become
inorganic mercury. The later two are toxic.

Most of the mercury found in deep sea fish, such
as swordfish, is organic. If eaten raw it remains
not only organic but bio-organic and is nutritive.
It facilitates buoyancy and dexterity in the
creatures who utilize it within their bodies. If
the fish is eaten raw, organic mercury is
beneficial.

When fish is cooked, the mercury becomes
inorganic and vaporous, causing it to be toxic.
The toxicity depends upon the health of the
individual eating it. The mercury becomes a
released radical, disturbing, poisoning and
damaging cells and cellular structures.

I have not found mercury in fish to be harmful as
long as the fish is eaten raw. Cooking of any
kind causes the fat that fish-bodies used to
protect themselves (from poisons) to detach,
resulting in the poisonous mercury being
created and released (free-radical). The
mercury in swordfish is a natural element in
that species that helps its mobility. Eating raw
swordfish will educate a body on how to utilize
mercury efficiently. I eat mainly swordfish
without ill incidences.

Fish contain alkylglycerols that remove toxic
mercury from their bodies. When we eat fish,
alkylglycerols remove mercury from our bodies.
(Udo Erasmus)

What the story is not telling us is that the FDA
has allowed millions of pregnant women and children to be poisoned with mercury from
vaccinations and other injections. Does it make
any sense that the poisoning from medications
exceeds that of their estimate for eating fish by
thousands of times, and they are so hysterical
over food poisoning?

It appears to me that this "fish story" is a smoke
screen to throw people off the track that they
suffer mercury-poisoning from medical
therapies rather than eating fish. Did you notice
that this story follows the lawsuits filed in the
last year regarding mercury-poisonings from
medication and the FDA's decades of approval of
the medical and dental mercury poisoning?

Fish is the scapegoat of mercury-poisoning
caused by the pharmaceutical and medical
industries. The amount of trace mercury in fish
is minuscule compared to the mercury in
medication. One injection containing thimerosal
contains more mercury than we could absorb in
cooked fish if we ate it everyday for 20 years. If
we eat the fish raw, the mercury is not rendered
a free-radical and remains chelated to fat and
minerals, preventing it from being absorbed,
except if needed. Trace amounts of mercury are
beneficial when bio-organically utilized by
vegetation-plankton-fish-animal, usually in that
order, just as are trace amounts of bio-organic
strychnine and naturally formed body
formaldehyde. Trace amounts of bio-organic
mercury facilitate buoyancy and dexterity.
Cooking fish makes the mercury in fish free-
radical and mildly poisonous.

The pharmaceutical and medical industry have
prepared the courts and public with
misinformation that suggest that eating fish is
the culprit rather than mercury-containing
medications and amalgams. Anyone attempting
to sue the pharmaceutical and medical
industries for mercury-poisoning will have to
prove that they were not fish-eaters. Most
people will simply think that they became
mercury-poisoned from eating fish and not even
think to blame and sue those industries.

Q: So many people I have gotten on the diet are
afraid to eat fish like tuna and swordfish because
of the mercury that's being talked and written
about. I have heard organic minerals from plants
are harmless and good for you, so I guess this is
the same from the fish who eat the seaweed, but
just wondered if you have something to send
around with that data in it so I can calm their
fears.

A: Metal toxicity can be attributed to a childhood
of eating canned, processed and chemically
treated food. My tests showed, 10 years ago,
that - if meat (seafood, fowl, white and red meat)
were consumed raw - 98 percent of the toxicity
that existed in it passed through the body
contained within relatively unaltered fat molecules.

My tests also showed that toxic minerals from
cooked and chemically contaminated food store
in the bones. It takes at least 7 1/2 years to
replace every cell in the bones. Logically,
according to Pottenger's work, it takes at least 5
generations to cleanse all of the toxicity out of
tissue. Since most toxic minerals store in bone,
it is probable that it could take as long as 40
years to clean out all of the metal poisoning
stored in bones.

The oceans are only 1% polluted, and that is
usually within 1/2 mile from shore. Land is over
37% polluted. Mercury in fish I have not found
to be harmful as long as the fish is eaten raw.
Cooking of any kind causes the fat that fish-
bodies used to protect themselves (from
poisons) to detach, resulting in the poisons
(mercury) being released (free-radical). The
mercury in swordfish is a natural element in
that species that helps its mobility. Eating raw
swordfish will educate a body on how to utilize
mercury efficiently. I eat mainly swordfish
without ill incidences or ill-symptoms of
mercury toxicity.

Foods that are high in raw minerals and fats
help the body detoxify toxic minerals in bones. If someone eats foods that are high in minerals
and fats, like seafood, s/he is promoting this
detoxification.

While living on Jekyll Island, I consumed up to 7
pounds of raw seafood a week, including shrimp.
The waters were known to have been
contaminated to some degree, including
mercury. The raw seafood helped me recover
from the poisonous mushroom. It helped
Owanza recover from 63 tumors.

The best detox a person could do to rid
her/himself of metal toxicity, including mercury,
would be to eat raw fish. I have observed that
eating lots of raw cream and coconut (or
coconut cream) helped soothe tissues disturbed
during toxic metal detoxification. Those creams
also protected tissue from mutation.

I wonder - if we expect the body to cleanse and
repair itself in less than the projected 40 years
that it may require to cleanse and heal to
optimal - are we too impatient? Instant
gratification is not logical concerning the body.
The FDA publicizing the dangers of mercury in
fish seems suspicious at best and conspiratorial
at worst. What the story is not telling us is that
the FDA has allowed millions of pregnant
women and children to be poisoned with mercury from vaccinations and other injections.
Does it make any sense that the poisoning from
medications exceeds that of their estimate for
eating fish by thousands of times, and they are
so hysterical over food poisoning?

It appears to me that this "fish story" is a smoke
screen to throw people off the track that they
suffer mercury poisoning from medical
therapies rather than eating fish. Did you notice
that this story follows the lawsuits filed in the
last year regarding mercury poisonings from
medication and the FDA's decades of approval of
the medical mercury poisoning? I hope that this
clarifies the mercury/fish dilemma for you.

[On August 22, 2011, Aajonus said: “Wild salmon
is all GMO now. I haven’t touched salmon for 6
years because every time I have 3 bites, I just
have to vomit. And there was always some GMO
type reaction”.]

[The following is Aajonus’s view stated by
someone else but included by Aajonus in The
Food Book. ]
Salmon is a very heavy oil one of the hardest to
break down. He had some milk with it and some
onion. Then you have a gaseous reaction. His
liver started detoxing and it couldn’t handle that
combination. Vitamin A in salmon is difficult to
digest. If you have a lot of salmon you do not
want to drink a lot of milk. Aajonus later
discovered that farmed salmon hatcheries were
mixed into oceans and bred with wild Salmon.
The offspring of those salmon can be toxic to eat and he suggested staying away from salmon
overall.

Q: What types of fish do you recommend?

Anything that’s wild caught, preferably seafood
rather than fresh water. Most fresh waters are
30 to 35% polluted. The ocean is only 2%
polluted. Unless you know where the fresh
water fish is not from a polluted area. I will not
eat fresh water fish unless I know the lake it
came from.

I stick with seafood. All oysters, clams, mussels,
scallops are all farmed. That means they are
allowed to fence off areas in the ocean. No one
is allowed to go in and mess with it. They don’t
add any pellets or anything like that to the
water. They spread them around so they’re not growing on top of each other. So they’re fine.

Q: Are oysters and shellfish OK for me? I seem to
want them and perhaps the minerals and fat in
them are helping to pull out some of the toxic
minerals in my body.

A: They are wonderful. Most of the toxins are
built into the shells. The rest passes through the
body unless cooked.

And I have lots of clients and here they can say
they have called me when they have been
emotional, suicidal, off the wall. Then I say how
much fruit have you been eating. Oh, I have
been eating a lot and I love the fruit. And I say
stay off it for a day or two and see how you feel.
They will call me in 24 or 36 hours and say wow
I feel great. They will forget to call me for a
couple of months and then call me and say how
terrible they are doing. Then I ask what are they
eating? Yeah, for about 5 days all I craved was
fruit. So cut out the fruit, they go right back to
being normal. So there are things that Owanza
and I see differently about, for different reasons.
And I love her dearly. She is one of the sweetest
spiritual people I have ever met. But I have to
bring it back down to earth just a little bit. I like
to be social, functional. I do not think that is
such a bad thing.

Q: I get a headache from eating fruit. I can’t take
carrot juice, anything.

A: Well, I suggest most people do not eat much
fruit because I found it nothing but bad all the
way down the line, especially for women and
moods, men and moods too. It cuts way down
on that moodiness.

One chronic fatigued individual, she had been
chronic fatigued from 16 until she came to me at 26. She had been on the diet for about 2 years.
Very slow progress. Finally got her moved to a
warm climate from Oregon where it is always a
raining and she is well affected by sunshine. So I
got her moved down to San Diego. She is doing
better. She got in touch with someone else I
work with occasionally who thinks this of any
carbohydrate or fruit or anything: she says that
it is poison. In the bible, the apple is the
poisonous food. Fruit is the poisonous food.

I thought it was a little crazy but then I started
hearing stories that I had not heard before,
getting to places that I had never heard before,
by doing such a thing. Fasting only on meat.
That is feasting. You do not eat anything but
meat and water. And it is working in some
situations. So I could not deny it. I started cutting out most fruit and I find it works well -
incredibly well in most situations. You know,
carbohydrates, even carrot juice – keeping it
way, way down.

Q: Eating a lot of fruit and vegetables?

Both over alkalinize the digestive system and
make it difficult to have an appetite for meat. In
fact, an over alkalinized digestive system will
more often be repulsed by meat. Also, too much
fruit causes mineral imbalances that deteriorate
teeth and bone, resulting in greater cravings for
cooked food, or a lot of raw cheese to balance
the mineral loses. However, for most bodies
transitioning from cooked food, lots of fruit
would be a welcomed change, even if it makes
them very emotional. I have found that too
much fruit, for most people that is more than
one piece per day, causes deep emotionality.

One of the greatest problems with a fruit diet, or
any high carbohydrate diet, is that humans are
not equipped to process it properly. This is the
strongest argument I have against high
carbohydrate diets: Advanced Glycation End
Products, a byproduct of the body using
glycogen from carbohydrate, store at a rate of
70% in a healthy individual and 90% in people
with health-challenges. This causes molds and yeasts (candida and herpes) to grow in our
bodies to dispel some of those carbohydrate
waste-products. As I wrote in an earlier email,
the degeneration of bone and teeth is significant
on high carbohydrate diets.

Q: I‘m surprised you don't see this as cleansing of
the emotional body.

A: I am not one to always apply the blanket
detoxification-theory to any and all
detoxification as normally conceived. Yes, it is
basically a detoxification, however, I have found
that stressful emotionality produced by over-
consumption of fruit is a detoxification of
excessive sugars, sugars that irritate the nervous
system and destabilize minerals and proteins,
causing the emotional body to feel insecure and
panicked. I have not found that one has to get
emotionally stressed to detoxify stored
emotional poisons. On the contrary, I have
found that stressful emotionality produced by
excessive sugar simply adds to exhaustion of
wonderful nutrients, as well as being hell on
relationships.

Q: Maybe the lack of fruit prevents emotional
healing?

A: If unhappiness resulted I might consider that a valid question. However, most of my clients
who were often stressed because of large fruit-
consumption and understood the connection,
reduced their fruit intake to minimal. Everyone,
approximately 180 ex-fruit-aholics, admit to
being much happier almost all of the time, and
that when stress hits they do not easily get
caught up in it.

With my patients, 90% of their stressful
emotionality has been resolved when it occurs
by eliminating fruit for several days.

Q: I'm not sure since I haven't met you or others
who practice your diet, but I'm just wondering
what you mean by "very emotional" and why you
consider it a problem.

A: Emotional joy is not a problem. Stressful
emotional irrational and aggression, whether
passive or aggressive - that is induced by too
much fruit-consumption - is avoidable,
unnecessary and, as I said, hell on relationships,
especially trust, loyalty and support.

Many nutritionist tell you to eat fruit alone.

Most nutritionists come from a vegetarian
/fruitarian background. When you are a
vegetarian/fruitarian you have very little
protein; that means you will develop very few
enzymes of an unusual nature. The longer you
are on that kind of a diet the less you will be able
to digest. So it gets to the point where you have
to start eating mono meals.

I know. I was there. But once you start eating
protein, then you can mix just about anything. I
do not recommend to people to eat fruits of any
kind with red meat because it mainly turns it
into pyruvate which is a protein sugar and your body can not use it for regeneration. Red meat
is very important for regenerating the glandular
tissue, especially the liver.

Q: Dates and raisins – are they fruits?

A: Yes, they are fruits however since they are
not high fluid they digest slower. Dates are
great brain food. I had a lapse there a moment
because my blood sugar got low and if does not
kick back in, I would go eat a date and butter
together. 2-3 dates and butter together and I
would not eat any more fruit for 3-4 days. And
that will be enough to carry me through.

Q: What about figs?

Figs are great. Dried but not fresh. Fresh figs
are good too but have a tendency to alkalize the
blood more than any kind of fruit. That is not so good in my state of raw foods. So if I eat a fig I
do not eat many if they are fresh. I can eat more
dried figs.

Q: What's the difference between a steamed and
non-steamed date

A: Steamed dates looks very glazed, almost
shellac-looking. They have been heat processed
and cause the same sugar problems that other
processed sugars cause, including damage to
intestinal flora and bacteria, blood, nerves and glands.

Q: Bananas? I eat them mainly as quick fuel
before a workout.

A: Quick fuel usually results in fatigue. Best to
eat fat with some meat and honey for quick,
long-lasting and strong fuel.

Ripe bananas stimulate increased emotionality.
It is preferable to minimize the intake of banana.

The main problem that I see is eating the banana
with cream before you sleep. This forces the
liver to work very hard during sleep and forces
the pancreas to detoxify. This will cause toxins
to dump into the stomach. These symptoms and
the cause are not bad things but if you want to
feel better, I suggest that you cease eating
banana with cream before going to sleep. I
suggest that you stop eating bananas. They often, in body-systems such as yours, cause a
repulsion to meat. Even though I love bananas, I
eat no more than 1/3 of a banana at a time and
usually with cheese and butter. I eat no more
than 6 bananas a year for the very symptoms
that you experience. I never never never have
bananas with cream because it creates many of
the symptoms you are experiencing.

Q: My family member has since yesterday
morning had his left side go numb. He does not
have control over it. It started with the hand,
then leg, today it is also the face somewhat the
face is lopsided and one side drooping. The only
thing he has done differently recently is that he
went on a fruit fast dried fruits and no liquid for
2 days and then another day of fresh fruit.. this is
a fast according to Professor Ehret in the 30s
he does say it is a horse fast

A: There are side-effects to fruit-feasts (fasts).
Advance Glycation End Products form and
collect, blood-fat levels drop dramatically
causing lesions to the nervous system, muscles
and sometimes glands. Dried fruit is all sugar with few, if any, active enzymes, and severely
taxes the pancreas, kidneys and nervous system.
Collectively, this causes dryness of tissues,
creating lesions in all tissue which can result in
temporary and partial paralysis, especially if it
occurs in the brain.

Q: How have supposed experts on fasts done so
well with their health... eg Shelton, Ehret, Fry
they have all written on it extensively and helped,
healed thousands of patients this way with fruit
fasts and then a lifelong diet of green raw
vegetables, fruit and nuts and seeds how have
they managed to do so well and look so well and
get rid of their illnesses like this??

A: If you knew them in person, you would not
want to have been around them. They were
hyperactive, impatient, often irritable and
sometimes extremely scattered thinkers. They
had no fat on their bodies to allow natural
relaxation and too much sugar in their systems
that over-excited their nervous systems. They all had forms of osteo degeneration.

Fruit overtaxes and stresses the pancreas. Raw
fat and protein are the only foods that allow the
pancreas to rest.

Q: My family member went to the hospital today on the insistence of his fellow workers at the
church as they are all worried

A: That is a shame because they will prevent him
from proper healing as they explore him. X-rays
can prevent proper healing for up to 18 months.
Since he has had some neurological damage, that
was not a good idea. If he scars rather than
heals properly, he will be slightly paralyzed for a
long time.

Q: At the hospital they say he has had a stroke...
is this true?

A: Any paralysis is a break in the flow of
neurological transmissions from the brain to the
body, whether caused by a clot that breaks off
from a wall during detoxification or by the
temporary shutdown during detoxification.
Regardless, the only proper way to address the
condition is to nourish the body so that it may
continue to detoxify the brain and properly heal.

Q: They obviously feel it is from his high blood
pressure and that he has not been taking his
blood pressure medication or not all the time (he
does sometimes when he feels it is bad)...

A: Half to a whole a grapefruit normally resolves
high blood-pressure. How much does he follow the diet? As I mentioned, a fruit feast is counter-
productive, especially during fall and winter.

Q: No clogging on brain but they want to do a
neurological test tomorrow, etc. Do you really
feel it is from the fruit fast... dried fruit and no
liquid not his high blood pressure or stress??

A: Sugars, natural or not, clump together when
dried. High blood-pressure is necessary for
people with plaque in or on the arteries. It
stretches the arteries. If they weren't stretched,
very little blood would pass through them.

Q: He feels it is pressure and stress... how can he
get off those high blood pressure pills safely
forever?

A: The pills are more damaging then the high
blood-pressure. The blood-pressure is high for a
good reason.

Q: He is on the diet 85% and has been for 2 1/2
years.

A: For his condition, I don't think he should do
anything less than 100% until his arteries are
clean enough.

Q: Would he need to do it 100% or have more of something to get off them completely..

A: Whether he gets on the diet 100% or not, the
pills could cause neurological toxicity that can
cause the problem he now faces. Go to
http://www.rxlist.com and enter the medication that
he is ingesting and discover the side effects.

Q: I started eating lots more fruit. All in all my
sugar intake is way up and you did say to me
initially that I should probably not eat more than
one piece of fruit per day.

A: You may need extra carbohydrate to digest
the fat. It is an indication that you are low on
enzymes to digest fat. However, usually meat
helps provide a better variety of enzymes for fat
digestion. As long as you eat the fruit with lots
of fat it will not harm you, but if you have too
much fruit you might get more tired and lose
your appetite for meat. This may result in a
feeling sluggish, but if it doesn't, it is probably
okay for a while.

Ginger will help pull off weight for some people.
But it also causes other detoxification. Ginger
helps digestion, helps break down substances,
allows pores to open better – sinuses, skin -
allows everything to relax more and you don’t
want to do that.

I use ginger and honey sauce with fish and
chicken. ... butter mixed with it. Some people
can have ginger in their drink; others shouldn’t.
Makes you irritable. You can have it on the
weight gain but not weight loss. Take about 3oz.
of butter (6 T), 2 heaping T of grated ginger, not
pressed but lightly grated (can also squeeze it if
you want but the fibers are good for keeping it
in your mouth), 2 T of honey – can use it as a
throat lozenge for dry, scratchy throat. You melt
it and blend it. Keep it in your mouth and
swallow it a little at a time. You can also have it as a sauce for any meat like a ginger candy.

In the lab tests with animals we found that
eating the raw glandular tissue helped increased
healing and energy. So anybody who has a
glandular problem, it does not have to be the
organ that you are eating, it happens with other
glands. If you eat a thyroid gland it can help the
pituitary, the pineal, the liver and other glands.
The liver in experiments felt muscle tissue was
harder than other glands and other organs but
not necessarily increasing the health of glands.
But the brain, the thyroid, the thymus would
help any other glands to regenerate quicker.
And those people who have chronic fatigue or
fibromyalgia, these will be a healthy boost for
you to give you back your energy quicker.

If the body is using the glandular tissues to
replace your toxic glandular tissue, then yes (it
will clean you out more) and most people
cannot replace glandular tissue because they do
not have the nutrients to reproduce it. So that is
why I suggest eating glandular tissue whenever
you can. I think I have told this story now twice
before that I was taking Armour Thyroxin T3 &
T4 - [T4 and T3 are important hormones
produced by the thyroid gland.] - everyday to
not have hypothyroid systems – to either delay
them or get rid of them. When I started taking
the freeze dried glandulars, I stopped having the
side effects, which was nice, but I was still
having to take the freeze dried thyroid tissue
regularly. When I began having the fresh glands
from the animals I went three months before I
had any hypothyroid systems. The next time it
was 6-9 months. The next time it was a year and a half. The next time it was 3 years. So by eating
the glands so it allows some how the body to
regenerate its own glands. This is the only way I
have ever seen. Usually people will build their
glands very gradually over 40 year period. If
you eat the glandular tissues whenever it is
available, it will help you have more energy and
bring your body back to life quicker. ... eating to
replace it. Let some of it rot.

Q: Glandular supplementation. I remember
reading something about that in your book.

A: I did experiments with freeze dried glandular
supplements. If you take them 5 days a month
they work very nicely. They are very helpful.
However since then I have done work with the
actual glands. Because I said the last time; the
first time I ate it to try it. I went 6 months
without having to take any t3 or t4.
Instead of the freeze-dried supplement I went
for more of the thyroid. Then the next time I
went 9 months before I had to take it again.
Then the next time I went 18 months and the
next time I went 3 years. So eating glandular
tissue will help you rebuild your gland so you do
not have to take supplements.

Q: I was just thinking about supplements because
I tried an experiment with the thyroid and I really
could not get it down me. It just rotted away in
the fridge and that was the end of that.

A: Well, try it less concentrated then. See what I
do is put an equal amount of thyroid with an
equal amount of milk, some red onion and it
tastes like clam chowder.

Q: Can you do that with liver too?

A: Yes

Q: Where can you get thyroid?

A: Whole Foods. You can order it from Whole
Foods. But make sure that it is not salted. So
what you might do, Joanne, is take a smaller
section. Use 1/10 glandular tissue to 9/10 milk
and some onion and drink it down. Or do what
Lori does and just slice it and swallow it down.
She will just take a slice of it and wash it down
with milk.

Q: Does liver fall into this same classification?

A: Yes it does. Lori will do it that way but I hate
my liver in milk. I will put it in a food processor with onion and make a pate out of it. And love it.
However I hate it with the milk.

A: I do not like the liver shakes either. I can not
eat it either. It is blending milk with liver. My
girlfriend loves it that way and other people do
too. I just take the liver and put it in a food
processor with some red onions and make a
pâté and it digests very easily that way.

Q: Why is the liver so strong? Is that because it is
a detoxifier?

A: No, it is because it is 60-80% fats. I never use
veal liver because the veal livers they normally
use are very anemic because they water down
the milk. And keep them in tents where they
never move. Now with the Coleman calves they
do not do that to but I have never been able to get the Coleman liver except on rare occasions.

I do not buy any liver from Whole Foods. I only
buy it from Wild Oats. Whole Foods carries
Manning’s Beef and Manning liver and
Manning’s feeds their cattle 15 % bakery waste
which are stale donuts. Wild Oats carries Harris
liver of Coleman’s liver. They are mainly grass
and grain feed. I called and talked with the
distributor of Vintage meats. He said that they
used to own Manning’s and they got out of
business with them because they started feeding
them 15% bakery waste and stuff like that. So
this fellow is very respectable and saying that it
is the same quality as Coleman’s but I have not
been able to get a hold of the owner because he
is on vacation. I am saying do not eat Manning’s
meat.

For some people I will recommend that they eat
liver and eggs but Daniel was chronically
fatigued and has lots of bile stored throughout
his system. Liver is a gland that is 60-80% fat
already. Then he puts an egg with it with lots of
fat. Then what happens? Too much oil in the
liver, so the liver has to reject some of the oil
that the liver has stored in it. So what kind of oil
do you think it is going to reject? Bile!

Q: I am interested in finding out if your research
into herbs has led to any evidence that herbs can
be effective in combination with a raw diet.

A: I have done very little to document the use of
herbs in conjunction with my Primal Diet.
However, most herbs that are utilized are
processed and dried, debilitating the usefulness
of the healing properties. Herbs should be
juiced fresh for effectiveness without toxicity.
Herbs that are processed and cooked create
more toxins than benefits.

Honey, unheated above 93 degrees F., provides
nutrients for digestion, utilization and
assimilation of amino acids that quickens
healing.

... There are two reactions from that. When the
bees collect the honey they swallow it in their
stomach. In their stomachs they produce an
insulin like substance which converts 90% of
the carbohydrates which is sugar to a protein
catalyst. This is good to eat with meat, good to
eat with eggs - as long as you can eat honey with
eggs. I can’t stomach it. 10% will still go into
carbohydrate and sugar. If that honey is heated
above 93, it starts the destruction of that insulin
like substance. Diabetics can eat honey that is
produced under 93 degrees with no problem
mostly. If it goes above 93 degrees and reaches
99 degrees or 100 degrees, it is all destroyed.

The sugar is not destroyed. A good sugar is not
a radical sugar until you go over 105 degrees.
However, the insulin like substance is destroyed
by 99 degrees. It starts to be altered by 93 and
is totally destroyed at 99.

So a diabetic will have a real problem with
honey that is heated at 93 degrees. People who
have candida, if they do not know that that
honey is heated above 93 degrees, will have a
problem because - although it is not a
destructive sugar - it will go help them clean out
AGE products that have created their candida
experience. Those yeasts feed on toxic sugars.
That is not a bad thing. It is a cure.

But most of the people who have that are very
slender people who have no fats in their system
and women who want to stay model like. So
they get so dehydrated that when those yeasts
feed on those toxic substances there is no fat
buffering anywhere. So their skin starts drying
out. The by-products of the yeast start causing
rashes or eczema on the skin and the skin dries
and falls off. And then they are itching all over.

Those people even with the 10 % in the honey
may have a detox reaction so they should have
some kind of fat – butter or cream. Butter is
preferable because it gets into the skin and will carry some of that honey to the skin so at least
when it neutralizes yeast that are there or helps
them draw out the AGE products that are stored
there, that are plaqued there. It will have some
lubrication with it so it does not destroy the
surrounding tissue.

Q: What is the proportion of the honey to the
cream or the butter?

A: It depends on the person’s condition but with
someone with candida I suggest 1/6 honey to
5/6 butter. So if you have 5 tbsp butter you
have one tbsp honey.

Q: Can you use coconut cream?

A: Yes you can, however the coconut cream still
has a little carbohydrate in it so I would make
the proportion 1/8 honey and 7/8 coconut. So if
people have a destabilizing effect from honey
similar to fruit, either the honey is over heated
or they are not taking enough fats with them.
Natural Rush still has not contacted me. They
are heating it or doing something to it. They are
processing it. Honey will naturally crystallize. If
the honey is coming from the desert, the honey
is no good. The bees will fan it to try to keep it
below 99 degrees. But it gets so hot that the
bees start dehydrating and the honey alone cannot keep them cool. They go down to a lower
level and let the honey burn. And they will not
eat that honey unless they are starving.

Bees ingest nectar to transport it. They produce
an insulin-like substances that alters 90% of the
nectar into protein catalysts for better protein
digestion, assimilation and utilization – called
honey. Heating honey above 93 degrees F.
gradually destroys the insulin-like substance,
rendering the honey into a common stable sugar
that can be deleterious to people who have
difficulty digesting or processing even natural
sugars. Bees fan the hive to prevent the
temperature from exceeding 99 degrees F. If the
temperature reaches above 100 degrees for
more than a 20 minutes the bees will not use the
honey to feed their young. Nor will they eat it
unless they are starving. Heating honey above
104 degrees F. damages the sugars and renders
them the same as any processed sugar that has
deleterious effects in almost everyone, including
the destruction of intestinal flora and villi.

Q: What is the maximum amount of honey you
can eat in a day to not cause a sugar
detoxification?

A: It’s not really the honey causing the sugar
detoxification if you’re eating unheated honey.

A bee collects the nectar, it swallows it and
produces an insulin like substance that converts
90% of the carbohydrate into enzymes for
digesting and utilizing protein. That doesn’t
show up until after it passes out of the
duodenum through the stomach. It will not
trigger a candida detox. It you eat too much
honey on its own it creates a protein deficiency
because it’s looking for protein to act on. It will
go into your own tissues and eat your tissue
looking for protein. It will go to tissue where
some kind of fungi is active. If there’s candida,
the yeasts will start going though the skin and
start itching. You can suffer a protein deficiency
if you’re eating too much honey. If you’re under
5’8”, more than ½ cup a day is too much. 6’ – ¾
cups a day.

Q: How do carbons get onto honey that is sealed
in the comb, and sealed with fresh propolis?

A: When beekeepers extract the honey, they cut
away only the top layer of wax (not much
propolis) to free the honey. Then most spin the
frames centrifugally to extract the honey. They
reinsert the old beeswax-frames back into the
hives and the bees refill them.
Beekeepers leave frames that are not full
enough to extract and, if they have smoked the
hive, those frames that remain from the last collection will be contaminated with honey.
If your beekeeper starts with new frames and
refrains from smoking the hives, there will not
be any carbons in the next batch of honey. I
mixed the chunky sample with some of the
gallon so at this point I don't know if it could be
one or the other.

Q: Is there any worry about ingesting bees’ wax?

A: Bees’ wax is a beneficial food. It is easily
dissolved by hydrochloric acid in the stomach
and throughout the small intestines. It especially
helps kidney and bladder tissue.

Q: Does eating unlimited amounts of unheated
honey cause problems for people with pancreatic
problems or candida?

A: Unlimited amounts of honey is beneficial as
long as a person’s body has a taste for honey.
When nectar is gathered by bees, they eat it. In
digestion they form an insulin-like substance
that converts 90% of the nectar sugars into
protein catalysts, and it then becomes honey and
regurgitates it into the comb.

The pancreas does not need to produce insulin
to properly assimilate and utilize UNHEATED
honey. As soon as the temperature of honey exceeds 93 degrees F. in processing, extraction
and bottling, the insulin-like substance
produced by the bees becomes inactive,
converting the honey into a concentrated sugar.
Sometimes unheated honey will cause
detoxification of Advanced Glycation End
Products (glycotoxins) that are stored along
with the acid pools on which candida yeast feed,
and sends them out of the body through the
skin, causing sensitive itchy sores. Therefore,
unheated honey may seem to exacerbate
candida, however, it is usually a cleansing of
candida, a detoxification that gradually
eliminates the substances on which candida
feeds.

Q: I have tried Really Raw Honey, Apithery Honey,
even an upstate small bee keeper's honey and was
adversely affected by every one of them. The one
and only honey, which I have been able to receive
benefit from is Honey in the Rough. It is thicker
than the others. It is not translucent. There is a
tremendous amount of white particles in it. From
what I understand this is pollen.

A: Not necessarily. Often, it is the center of
crystallization; crystals grow. Some people, at
first, have better success with crystallized
honey.

Q: This just might be the influencing factor. I
talked to a bee keeper and he said that they
actually have pockets for the pollen which they
pick out. The Honey in the Rough company
(Moorland Apiaries) doesn't produce the pollen
separately (to the best of my knowledge) so
perhaps they just include it with the honey along
with the propolis and comb.

A: If the concentration of protein in pollen is
responsible, you can test it by adding raw fresh
soft refrigerated bee pollen to a honey with
which you do not do well. If it helps, you will
know that pollen honey assimilation.

Q: The propolis is antibacterial and antiviral,
which would make the honey much more
energized.

A: Propolis is dried tree sap and is very difficult
to digest much at a time.

All these factors create a whole honey. It allows
me to digest any fat without feeling like I even
ate something sweet.

Unheated-above-93-degrees-F honey is mainly
responsible for protein digestion. Honey helps
fat burn.

Too much honey will cause a protein deficiency
if you continue the binge too long. If you begin
getting easily irritable, getting the shakes or lose
concentration, you have symptoms of protein-
deficiency. There is nothing wrong with an
occasion milk/honey binge.

Honey butter combination – the butter is mainly
a fat that is so easily utilized and broken down
in the body, rapidly. It can get into the tissues
and protect you very quickly. It is there to bind
with the toxins. It is there to lubricate the
system. It is there to give you energy and will do
all three. It does not sooth the nerve tissue as
much. Cream is better for that. Butter can be
utilized in 3 hours. Cream in 6-8 hours

The honey provides the body with enzymes to
search out proteins able to utilize the fats
properly, either as a lubricant for protection or
as fuel for energy or as detoxifier as a solvent. It
delivers it and makes it available instantly and
there is about 10% sugar in the unheated honey
so it gives it that proportion that is necessary to
make a slight bit of alcohol to utilize the fat as a
fuel or solvent. The only time I recommend 50-50 is in an emergency situation otherwise I
recommend it 1honey to 4 or 5 parts butter.

Q: I want to know if bee’s wax has benefits to any
of your organs.

A: Yes, ... to kidneys and all the tissues in
general. It helps strengthen and helps make
resilience towards penetration of any acidic
cells. The wax that is dissolved by the HCL - the
body can use it along with fats to make a sealant
with the cells. It is especially beneficial for the
kidneys because of all the ammonia that the
kidneys manufacture. Now, in the wax there is a
sheet and all the squares of honeycomb there is
a sheet in there which is heat cooked pressed.

Q: So that is toxic.

A: Yes. So I suggest that you just scoop off the
top and then flip it over and give the rest to the
ants.

Chunky honey helps stabilize, lubricate, and
protect the liver and kidney cells by forming a
protective coat around the cells so they will not
be damaged.

Q: Can you tell me if it is ok to freeze bee pollen as
well?

It is better not to keep frozen for more than a
month and it should only be refrigerated one
week prior to consumption. The hull on pollen
is extremely difficult to dissolve. If eaten
without thaw it will be relatively indigestible.

Q: Aajonus, I remember talking to you a while
back about storing bee pollen and you said to
keep it in the fridge. I talked to the guys from
Honey Pacifica and they said they do put it in the
freezer, but it does not freeze. My point is that or
I should say my question is does it matter and if so
is there a pollen that is not frozen? I was told that
all pollen has to be frozen so it does not get mold.
Any comments?

A: Many nutrients in pollen are damaged by
freezing. Honey Pacifica will supply us with
unfrozen pollen but believe that pollen should
be frozen. Mold on bee pollen is beneficial.
Pollen is like a nut with a shell. Once it is dried,
it is very hard and difficult to digest. That is why
it should be fresh soft and refrigerated. The
shell is more easily broken down in digestion
when moldy. The inner nut is rarely affected by
mold. I do not freeze my pollen.

Q: Now you mentioned that eating meat and
avocado are great energizers, what would you
recommended for regenerating tissue that relates
to ingestion of protein and meats?

A: He asked what helps for you to regenerate
tissue. Eat royal jelly with any of the meats. And
you only need a small amount. Only the size of a
pea every couple of days. If you want to
regenerate nerve tissue or intestinal tissue have
it with chicken. If you want to regenerate liver,
muscle or blood, have it with red meat including
liver. If it is muscle meat you are after have it
with steak or ground beef.

Q: The size of a pea every other day?

A: Yes.

Q: Is this like the lubrication drink?

A: No. The lubrication drink goes in deep to the
tissues to stabilize and lubricate and protect the
body. The royal jelly helps the regeneration of
tissue when it is eaten with the meat. It helps
people become alive, become younger, have
more cells alive in their body.

Q: How could Pure, Raw, Unheated, Unsmoked
etc. etc. Honey destroy the value of the Royal
Jelly?

A: Mixing honey alters the regenerative value of
royal jelly.

Q: I also do not understand how honey, even raw
unheated honey, could be good as, doesn't that
feed candida?

A: Yeasts feed on stored sugars that could not
and cannot be properly digested or utilized.
Yeasts, including candida, are a detoxification of
those sugars. When the bees collect the nectar
they ingest it. It becomes honey when their
bodies convert the nectar into protein catalysts
(90%) with an insulin-like hormone.
Temperatures above 93 degrees F. begin to
damage the insulin-like hormone. At 100
degrees F. the hormone is completely destroyed
and the honey becomes 100% sugar again,
although not a honey on which yeast can easily
feed unless the temperature of the honey
reaches above 105 degrees F. Unheated honey
often detoxifies undigested and/or unassimilable sugars, freeing the sugars on
which candida feeds. But, at the same time it is a
cleansing that is quicker and less symptomatic.

Attacking the body's symptoms will only
advance disease. As long as non-utilizable
sugars are a constituent of the tissues, yeast will
flourish. The idea is to mitigate the side effects
to where it is not noticeable, or at least tolerable.

Q: I read what you wrote about yeast but I was
wondering if you included live yeasts when you
said they were not prepared properly. I have
heard they eat it alive in Europe but people here
worry about the swelling. I am wondering if the
live organisms would clean up the gut and
provide valuable nutrients as they multiply.

A: Body yeast feed on stored sugars that could
not and cannot be properly digested or utilized,
such as candida. Yeast, including candida, are a
detoxification of those sugars.

Eating live yeast can aid detoxification.
However, consumed yeast is usually not the
yeast that the body uses. It manufactures, or
breeds, a variety specific yeast for itself.

Q: What would live yeast do for me?

A: Provide creatures who feed on carbohydrates.
Yeast are mainly protein even though they feed
on carbohydrates.

Q: If the swelling is too much, could I deactivate
the yeast with garlic or other foods just to get the
nutrients in the yeast?

A: Swelling is usually the result of eating
processed yeast, or eating yeast that have been
fed processed food.

Q: What company feeds the yeast the best?

A: I do not know of any. I suggest that you grow
your own in raw milk.

Q: If unheated honey freezes, are the enzymes, or
anything else in the honey altered or destroyed?

Frozen honey has had its insulin-like substance
altered to a minor toxin. Diabetics and people
with blood-sugar problems will not do well with
it.

Q: I have a question for you re freezing of honey.
Honey doesn't freeze until way below 0°F due to
the antifreeze properties of the sugars. The
colder I store honey, the less it granulates, and the
better the quality remains as far as enzyme
breakdown, flavor, color, aroma, and desirability
to the bees. Plus, my low-moisture desert honeys
granulate rock hard!

A: Although honey does not solidify until below
0° F., certain properties of the honey are destroyed, such as enzymes and the insulin like
substance.

Q: My question is, what is the coldest
temperature I can store honey at and not destroy
the insulin-like properties? Have you run any
actual tests after cold storage? Honey granulates
most rapidly at 57°F; cooler temperatures retard
granulation. When honey granulates, the liquid
between the sugar crystals drops in sugar
concentration, and no longer behaves like pure
honey (it can spoil, degrade, or ferment).

A. Yes, if stored in barrels or plastic at
temperatures above 70° F. I have not found it to
ferment in glass out of sunlight even at 75° F.
Honey should never be stored in plastic except
lexane. Honey stored in barrels begins losing
enzymes between 40° F.- 36° F, that is, I can tell
that the enzyme activity has been impaired
because of the way honey affects certain people.
I suggest that 40 ° F. should be the lowest
temperature that my clients receive honey.

This is cooked. It is like the sap, which has to be
cooked to thin it out. It is also difficult to digest.

Q: I am finding myself unable to tolerate ANY
honey (I have the Really Raw brand) – it creates
symptoms of rage and inflames candida for me,
just as fruits do (even eaten w/fat).

A: That is an indication that your nerves have
been dried raw, however these symptoms will
diminish with time on the diet. I suggest that
you always eat the honey with fat, especially
cheese, until you no longer regularly experience
those symptoms, and eat the honey at times that
you can afford to experience those symptoms.

Q; A good story is how I cured my hypoglycemia
with Aajonus’s diet. I started on the diet almost 2
years ago and the one thing I did is eat bunches of
honey. I could not stop eating honey. It almost
broke me. I have eaten 1-2 cups a day and this is
over a period of 1-2 years. Now I took my blood
sugar a lot because I have a friend who has
diabetes so I used a little machine so this is totally
scientific. Before I started the honey I would
notice my blood sugar would be in the 60’s or 70’s
which is quite low. After I ate the honey for a
while I checked my blood sugar everyday and it
was always around 100 or 95. I think it is
absolutely because I overdosed on the honey. And
now I really do not want the honey anymore. It is
funny now that my blood sugar is fine now I am not fanatical about the honey. Do you agree with
that?)

A: Yes, that makes a lot of sense because a lot of
people say that you are suggesting half a cup of
honey for someone that is diabetic. I would say
yes. When the bee collects the nectar, he
swallows it So you are eating his puke. When it
is in his stomach, he secretes an insulin like
substance which converts 90% of the
carbohydrate into sugar into enzymes for
digesting, utilizing, and assimilating protein. So
every time you eat unheated honey, you are
supplying an insulin like substance into the body
which gives the pancreas a break. Also it gives
nutrients to help the pancreas rebuild, if you are
eating the raw meat. Eating a lot of honey is
very helpful to healing a diabetic or someone
who has hypoglycemia.

Q: Do you eat it by it self or with something else?

A: It does not matter. Any way you want.

Q: I just spoke with someone from the Volcano
Island Honey company and the honey that they
are selling for $165/48 bottles is fermented
honey.

The fermentation is caused by moisture mixed
with the honey and ambient yeast. It changes the
consistency and smells a bit like alcohol or
vinegar.

Currently it is kept refrigerated (well, she wasn't
very clear on that. She says refrigerators are kept
at 52 and this is kept at 60. Who knows.

She suggests keeping it refrigerated to stop this
fermentation process.

First, I thought you said at a Q&A that
refrigeration of honey was a no no?

Second, Is fermented honey okay, beneficial or
just not harmful?

A: It depends on how fermented. Eaten with lots
of cream or butter, it creates tremendous
energy. Taken alone, it might cause irritability,
dryness and/or too much detoxification. Since it
is winter, there is probably no need to
refrigerate it. I suggest you keep it stored in a
low cupboard.

Q: What about eating raw insects?

A: There are Instictos that do. Now I met some
people from Peru who lived in the jungles and
that was their protein because in those
concentrated tribes, animals were over hunted
so they had to resort to insects. I had one
girlfriend from Peru who up to 10 years old
lived in the jungle and she just takes caterpillars
off the corn and just pops them. Down there in
the Amazon she said they had worms this long
and this big around and she just popped them.
Those were considered a specialty. I am sorry I
have not been able to do that.

I have eaten red ants with dates and that is all
that I could do and I did not do that
purposefully. The ants got into my dates during
a very hot time in the desert and I was sitting there chewing them thinking oh these are really
good. They taste like caramel. Why do they
taste so good? And I break it open and all these
ants are crawling all over. But at that time of the
day it was 140 degrees so the ants just kind of
stay where they are. And I had taken them up to
this old coyote den because it is cooler in the
caves but the dates were still hot and the ants
did not know until I broke it open. So I made
sure I ate my dates at that time of the day
because those red ants were delicious.

Q: You ate them again?

A: Oh yeah, everyday that I was there. It seemed
that when it touched the fluid in your mouth it
paralyzed them. They never bit me once and I
ate a lot of them.

I do not know if I ever finished answering the
insect thing. Some people do very well with
insects. I have such a problem eating insects. If
I were starving and had no meat I might eat
insects.

Q: Lube formula – in book he says use whatever
fat is available because not all people can get the
fats we can here. Question is can you use half
butter and half cream?

A: You can, but the point of the lubrication
formula is to get the fat in the skin and the
connective tissue, in the lymph. The cream will
be absorbed readily by the glands and the
available organs instantly. The cream will never
get to the outer tissue. The butter is harder to
utilize except for the outer tissue. Butter is best,
coconut cream after that, then cream.

Q: Lube formula and coconut cream – does it
really matter when you have it? Can you have it

in the middle of the day?

A: No, if you’re having it once a day it’s better to
have it in the evening. Nerves detoxify and
rebuild after the sun goes down – about 3 to 4
hours after that. So somewhere around 10:30
pm.

Q: A woman hates the lube formula. She still has
very dry skin.

A: I said her skin is the best I’ve seen. It doesn’t
matter if you like it or not, just do it. Everything
should be room temperature. You can put it
warm water. You want it for the skin, bones and
lymphatic system. If you add more honey, it
becomes more fuel or for sexual energy. I put
the blades in hot water so when it hits the butter
it keeps liquid. Metal heats faster than anything.

Drink lube formula. Your body needs every bit of
food you eat because it’s been starving so long.
The glands are going to take it first, the muscles,
the organs. Connective tissue, bones, skin and
lymph are last to be fed. Skin dries up. Body
uses up fats and does not leave anything for the
skin. It happens to about 60% of the people on
this diet. It’ll go through phases. The way to get
the fat into the skin and deeper tissues is the
lubrication formula (egg, a fat – coconut cream is a substitute – not the best; butter is best to get
to the deeper tissues, or cream, lemon juice, tiny
bit of honey / proportions somewhere 1 egg to 2
1/2 oz of butter to 1 T of lemon juice to 1 t of
honey. For bigger people double that). Have it
once a day.

Q: I used to eat a lot of seaweed salad before I
started you diet years ago. I get the good quality
seaweed, Maine coast and I soak it in lemon juice.
I wanted to see what you thought of that.

A: Well, you see cows out there grazing on the
hay. Do they digest that very well?

Q: Do cows digest hay?

A: When a cow is eating fresh grass and herbs,
their stool is a just a patty. When they are eating
all kinds of dried stuff in the winter you will see
all kinds of fibers going everywhere. Vegetation
is impossible to digest whole except for a
fraction, 10 % at best. So if you put stuff you can not digest in your body, your body is going to
work very hard to try and do it but it is never
going to happen. Seaweed is very difficult. It is
almost the same ratio of mineral concentration
including sodium that is in our blood. So our
vegetable secretions do not get near breaking
that down. Then when you dehydrate it on top
of it, there is no way you can break down
seaweed.

Q: Even if you reconstitute it?

A: You can do that, but it would take whey,
vinegar or lemon juice and it would have to soak
for 24-36 hours to break down enough to get
some nutrients but then you are not going to
have any enzymes in it. You are just going to get
a high mineral content that could cause mineral
imbalances because it is not in a whole food
anymore. I mean if you went out and got fresh
algae and ate it, you might be able to get some
use out of it. Whole vegetables will cause you to
be over alkaline in the intestines and bowels;
that means you will not be able to digest any
other foods properly. Also the bacteria are in
the colon; you are supposed to have 3-5 lbs of
bacteria in your colon. It feeds on acid material.
If you put alkaline material in the colon those
bacteria can’t feed on it so what happens –
constipation. Just the opposite of what happens on a cooked diet. Cooked diet meat is overly
acidic so you eat some raw vegetable with it and
it helps neutralize it so then it balances out.

But on this diet the vegetation does not get
digested in the small intestine. A vegetarian
animal has 2-4 stomachs and have 2 ½ times
longer digestive tracks than we do plus 60,000
times more enzymes to disassemble the
cellulose molecules. To break down the fats and
protein it takes them 48 hours to pass that
through. In a human, raw vegetables can pass
though in 24 hours with less than 20% digestion
in it. Those alkaline fibers constantly secrete
alkalinity into the bowls. The bacteria in there,
the E. coli, the salmonella, the campylobacter
can no longer feed on that matter in the
intestines so what happens – the fecal matter is
very small, it is very hard like granite and slit
you to pieces if you pass it, or be very
uncomfortable. 60-80% of fecal matter are
bacteria. The by-products of bacteria or vero
toxins prevent you from getting cancer and will
also help reverse it so all this fear about E. coli is
absolutely garbage. Now for the last 20 years
the University of Toronto has been using vero
toxins from E. coli to completely shrink brain
tumors in 7-15 days. ... not only the tumors but
the vessels going to the tumors. A company
called Vion has put an attenuated salmonella that does the same thing. But you know what
Vion did? They attenuated the salmonella so it
would not eat the tumor away. It would just
isolate them. Now they are putting a chemical
into it like a chemotherapy to go in and dissolve
it. So they want you to buy their salmonella. If
you get good whole salmonella and eat it, it is
going to go in there and do the whole job of
getting rid of your whole tumor. With their
brand $8,000 a shot. Great business. Eat the
high meat and take care of that. Eat foods
properly and you will generate enough of that to
protect you from cancer or reverse it.

Q: Question related to the different digestive
tracts and the structure of a human versus an
omnivore.

A: ... herbivores and what we are basically –
carnivores. We have a digestive tract about 2 ½
times longer than an herbivore. They have 1-3
stomachs more than we do. They chew their
food, they swallow, they regurgitate it after they
mix enzymes to break the cellulose down; they
regurgitate and re-chew it sometimes 5 times
before they finally let it pass through. Plus that
pulp passes through 48 hours in their digestive
tracts. It goes through us in 24 hours. We have
60,000 times less enzymes to disassemble the
cellulose and get the protein and the fats from the cellulose.

So basically we exhaust our system and do not
get much from whole vegetables. Cats and dogs
and other types of carnivores have 15 times the
HCL we have in the stomach. They dissolve it all
right there. Our digestive tracts are 3 times
longer than theirs. But we secrete the same
amount of HCL. We just do it in different
chambers throughout the small intestines. We
do the same as they do just on a slower basis.
Also dogs and cats do not have very powerful
adrenal glands so they have to hunt and chase
their prey, knock them around to get the
adrenaline flushed in there or they will not be
able to hunt the next time. We do not have to do
that and that is part of the process of the high
bacterial content of us moving the meat through
a little slower – 16 hours as opposed to 3 hours.
A dog and a cat, if you feed them raw meat, can
break that totally down in 3 hours and it will
pass through in 10 hours completely in their
system. We have an entirely different process of
doing that but we do it well.

Q: I know that any kind of vegetable matter with
the meat creates an energetic result for energy.

A: Wait, you mean vegetable with meat?

Q: Yeah, like your green juice or avocado with
meat if you want sexual energy.

A: No, green juice and meat will give you a
problem. Green juice will neutralize your ability
to digest the meat and the meat will neutralize
your ability to digest the green juice. All flesh
food is acidic. If you go putting an alkaline juice
with the acid food neither of them will digest
and you will neutralize it.

Q: So do you put any kind of condiment with your
chicken like cut up onion?

A: Bell pepper will do. Just a little to flavor it.
But an onion even though it is a vegetable is an
acid. So is garlic

Q: So is a tomato.

A: It is a fruit. It is an acid fruit and can be eaten
with cheese. As long as you keep it as a flavoring
you will get away with it.

Q: So, eat separately avocado and meat?

A: No. You can eat avocado and meat together
but my experience is that eating meat and
avocado together will create more energy.
Either sexual or whatever you are doing to let
off your adrenaline. You will just have more
energy. It is be used as fuel verses regenerating
cells.

Q: Seaweed with meat is all right?

A: Seaweed for a human is almost impossible to
digest. It is like any vegetables.

Q: The seaweed I am talking about is juicy from
the Japanese market.

A: It is almost impossible to digest in the human
digestive tract just like vegetables.

Q: I would like to know how you know if you
should eat red meat, fish, etc. I do not know much
about it so I do not know which I should be doing
the most. The other question is how do you check
you pH if you are using a litmus or when you
check you blood, urine or saliva – what numbers
you look for?

A: We are not looking for numbers. We are not
looking for anything from the scientific
community at all. You can take all those tests
and shove them because they do not apply. The
acid I am talking about is the acid that is
immediately in the blood. If you have acidity in
the blood you are likely to be anorexic, not have
an appetite or be irritable.

If you have any of those symptoms, you are acid;
then you want to eat more of the white meats
and less of the red meats.

If you are very sluggish, lethargic and have no
energy, red meat stimulates the adrenals and
muscles to give you more energy. The white
meats are much more relaxing so that is how
you do it.

Looking at you, you need a lot of red meat
because there is still a lot of anemia. I would say
if you are very white or yellow you need lots of
red meat. The yellow indicates you are
jaundiced, that you have bile in your tissues.
That represents that your liver is not very well.
The only food that repairs liver quickly is red
meat.

Q: If you eat the red meat how long will it take for
you to become irritable?

A: It depends on the individual how well they
digest it. Could be 10 minutes.

Q: What if you are irritable and sluggish?

A: That is the way I was. I mixed it. I could have
chicken alone but if I had beef I had to have fish every time. So if I had 4 oz of beef, I had 2 oz of
fish.

Q: I have not eaten much fish yet; should I get
some Ahi?

A: As long as whatever you eat is not farmed. I
could not tell you especially unless I saw you. I
can read certain things by looking at you but
what is on the inside I can tell to a certain extent
but not all. So I would not want to lead you off
into an area where I would subvert your
instincts that would probably be more than my
advice without my full knowledge of
information.

A: Are you mostly drinking your 4 cups of juice a
day?

Q: Yes mostly I do it.

A: For a system like yours that is that thin, you
are going to get acid very quickly because your
system is basically anorexic. That means it eats
itself if it can not find the protein. You will get
twice as much acid as other people. You will be
repulsed by meat. Especially red meat.

Q: So what do we do?

A: You eat chicken and things like that. Chicken
and fish. You do not need to eat it all at one time. Break it up into 3 meals.

Q: The other thing is ...acidophilus?

A: Candida is there to eat up AGE products that
are sugar. You can not get rid of the candida
without getting your body clean of those AGE
products. That sugar garbage. That is it. So you
have to live with your candida.

Q: Is pre frozen grass-fed meat worse or better
than organic fresh grain-fed meat?

A: Freezing destroys most of the CLA and
enzymes in grass-fed. It would be better to eat
organic grain-fed.

Q: Are there any source books that explain how
the protein of meat is damaged when it is frozen?

A: There are a few places where you could find
this information but you will have to search for
it. It was brought to my attention that there was
a typo in my book regarding protein loss from
freezing. It should read that there is only a 25%
loss in protein when frozen.

Most of my research was done from observing
the difference in animals fed unfrozen raw meat
and frozen raw meat. Glandular development
and growth was slower. Tissues broke down
easier; symptoms of aging were increased by
25% after mid-age.

A couple of raw fooders out here use the
example of the Inuits eating frozen fish, etc., as
an OK for eating meat that has been frozen.

Normally, the Inuit ate the fish frozen no longer
than 5 minutes to 24 hours. Given the longevity
of other animals on non frozen raw diets, the
Inuits should have lived to 140 years. The Inuits
lived to the same ages as we do. This frozen-
factor may be the entire basis for a shortening of
lifespan.

Q: I hope this finds you well. I've read your books
and have been easing into the Primal Diet, yet I'm
having trouble finding fresh organic chicken. I've
only found frozen here in Kansas. Would it be
okay to up the portions of a frozen chicken to get
the required nutrients?

A: Frozen meat cannot be used to promote
cellular division. Try to find a farmer who has pastured chickens.

[ CLA (Conjugated Linoleic Acid) is a naturally occurring
fatty acid ]

Q: A couple of times now I have gotten a really
iron-like or mineral rich tasting meat from
Northstar bison. I have gotten it in both round
roast and sirloin tip. Not too much different than
liver. Part of me is telling me that this mineral
rich meat is good for me, so I have been plugging
my nose the same as I do when I eat high meat
and eating it. Another part of me thinks if it
tastes so bad (I gag if I don't plug my nose) I
shouldn't be eating it. Have you ever run into
this?

A: This is common for people with some glandular disorders/toxicity. When CLA-rich
meats are eaten, the glands discard toxins that
often include free radicals, causing a repulsion
to metallic odors and tastes. I use a sauce to
combat my repulsion.

Q: We are struggling here without our dear
butter – yet I am doing my best with plenty of
meat..

A: Eating meat without plenty of fat sometimes
causes you to lose energy. Sometimes it causes
the proteins to be used for intensive
regeneration that makes a body go into an
intense healing state, that is, sleep. Fat provides
the fuel for strength and energy. I suggest that
you eat coconut cream, as described in my book,
and other fats with your meat. Drinking green
vegetable juice that is 80% celery and 20%
parsley with a little slice of lemon or lime (juiced
with rind) helps stimulate energy when enough
fats are consumed.

Q: I have been eating rabbit recently. I read
somewhere, though, that some people who ate
only rabbit in the wilderness after being
shipwrecked etc., nearly starved because of the
low-fat content of rabbit meat.

A: Rabbits are mainly fed processed alfalfa
pellets which have no live vitamins or enzymes
and much toxicity. Rabbits raised in this way
produce deficient and diseased meat. It has
nothing to do with the fat-content.

Q: If you’re eating tough meats...

A: You have to eat it just like that. It is good
exercise for your teeth. The Italians and other
tribes slice lunch meat thin and it will just tear
to pieces. Then grind it. I put it in a food
processor. I will slice it in slices. Then put it in a
food processor and pulsate it. Just leave it on for
30 seconds and you are going to have minced
meat. It will be like a pâté. I do not care for it
like that unless it is liver with onions. But if it is
regular meat I like it a little bit chunkier so I will
pulsate it for maybe 15 seconds.

Filet mignon is too fat deficient. Most often the
body develops weak cells from it. You might try
slicing sirloin steak very thinly and eating it.
Your body may want the meat separate from the
fat. In ground, the fat is nearly homogenized
and absorbs much of the enzymes from the meat
and then the meat does not digest as well. You
can always chop it each day in a food-processor,
such as a Cuisinart.

Q: Do you eat pork?

A: Yes if I crave it. But you can get organic pork.
You can go to health food store and get organic
pork. And there is no trichinosis. Trichinosis
again is something you naturally have in your
body. Whether you have pork cooked or raw
you have trichinosis in your body. It is just
waiting for enough decay of that particular
tissue to become active.

Q: I would say if you are cooking it at 300 degrees
that all the bacteria are dead?

A: It is dead for that particular period of time.
But once the meat absorbs moisture and other fluids it goes into degenerative tissue again and
it will create bacteria again, even trichinosis. I
have seen this over and over again. If you cook
at 700 degrees it will not. It will mold and
degenerate after that. That is the highest
temperature between 600-700 degrees that I
cooked meat and could not get meat to re-
flourish. And it is leather at that point. Who is
going to eat leather? So you are going to get
bacteria.

Q: So this is not some pre-pressed generation you
are talking about? This is just that 212 degrees
for 15 minutes really does not sterilize your meat?

A: It does temporarily. Once it is out, then it
starts to rot and decay again.

Q: So you are saying that organisms really survive
the heat in some sort of state?

A: Either that or they are introduced.

Q: Introduced from where? You talked about ...

A: That was one test. That was not cooking the
meat first. The other tests that I did were not as
extreme as that.

Q: So you are not sure where these organisms appear from?

A: Well, lets say that I go out and kill a goat and
he rots in the field. We have worms that will
show up. We have vultures that will show up
and crows that will show up. The crows and the
vultures are not indigenous to the tissue to that
animal. But they will come and eat it. But do
you blame the crows and the vultures for the
dead carcass? No. That is why you can not
blame the E. coli, salmonella, and trichinosis for
the dead carcass. They just feed on it. It is there
job to feed on tissue that is in degeneration.

Q: My question after you heat at 300 degrees for x
number of minutes where does any life appear
from?

A: It could appear extemporaneously.

Q: It could just come out of nothing kind of like
fruit flies.

A: From what I understand about a fruit fly, they
are spontaneously part of fruit for some reason
because you can hermetically seal that and have
the fruit contained in an isolation chamber and
never exposed to any insects and all of a sudden
the fruit flies will appear. So that to me is like
the worms and the parasites. They are natural and indigenous to the fruit tissue just like
parasites and bacteria are indigenous to animal
tissue. But the crows and vultures are not but
they will come and feed on it.

Q: I cook my steak for 10 second on each side and
looking at it I can see only 5 per cent of it is
cooked. I wonder if that would ruin the remaining
95 per cent uncooked.

If you were to burn 5% of your body, what do
you think the effects would be? How well could
your body reuse your burned tissue? Cooking
meat creates heterocyclic amines and lipid
oxides that are poisonous. Of course you will
receive benefit from partially cooked meat. It is
entirely up to you the degree of health that you
want to create.

Q: Have you noticed a difference in ground beef?
Last week I went to Wild Oats in Pasadena. I
noticed the beef was dry and brown. I asked the
meat cutter. He didn't seem to know anything.

A: It sounds like not many people are buying the
ground beef quickly enough, if it looks dry. The
brown is usually indicative of being too cold. If
it turns red after minutes at room temperature,
it is fresh but too cold. If it does not turn red
then it has oxidized.

Q: I have one quick question. When I chew and
chew, chicken or beef, there is usually a white
piece of something left over that will not break
up. Is this something I should swallow or throw
out?

A: It isn't necessary to chew meat. As long as it
is raw, it dissolves easily in the stomach and
intestines. Chewing meat too much can cause
over acidity in the mouth causing blisters or
sores in the mouth. The gristle should be
swallowed, too.

The omega-fat business is business; selling a
product. Marketers separate the differences and
sell them. Every product needs a pitch. But
because certain chemical reactions occurred in
test tubes does not mean they happen in the
body. The health benefits and superiority of
omega fats are speculation and have had no
long-term empirical proof.

The comment in the email below (a comment on
Elnora Van Winkle’s email extolling that animal-
fats were health-giving) that "More harm than
good comes from eating the fat of grain-fed
animals" is idealism rather than science.
Thousands of people and I have mainly eaten
grain-fed butter, cream, eggs and beef-fat and have reversed diseases. That is empirical fact
and evidence. Only recently have we been able
to acquire grass-fed dairy, beef, lamb and eggs. I
am conducting some empirical tests to
determine any physiological differences that
develop by eating grain-fed and grass-fed beef.

I will conclude the initials tests and make the
results known in 3 years. However, after one
year, I have noticed a marked difference in
sexual energy between the two. In many people
who ate grass-fed beef, sexuality decreased over
time. However, when grain-fed beef was re-
introduced to their diet, sexuality rapidly
increased. In some people, I have noticed that
they are not as mentally acute on grass-fed beef.
This may be because their nervous systems have
been conditioned to utilize mainly
carbohydrates as fuel. This may change as a
person adapts to grass-fed. Thus far, those are
the only differences I have noticed.

I agree that grazing is more natural but I do not
know, and evidence has not shown me, that
cows and chickens are sick because they are fed
mainly grains. Healthy animals like cows and
chickens live very well on grain because they
have systems to handle it. I noticed on my
grandparent’s farm that chickens fed mainly
grain tended to be more excitable and anxious but were healthy generation after generation.
My grandparent’s sheep and dairy cows, during
the winter, tended to have the opposite reaction
on mainly grain – they seemed to me more timid - but strong and healthy.

That you have reduced disease eating raw
animal food is exciting, but cannot be solely
correlated with eating grain fed animals vs grass
fed. It might be a good idea to reread my book. I
qualified my findings in it. In it, I qualified many
diseases that did not reverse without eating raw
animal food. The reversals were entirely based
on grain-fed animal products. I do not know yet,
if eating grass-fed beef will increase the reversal
of disease.

It is not good science to correlate one particular
function with one particular shift in diet.

If repeated shifts back and forth present the
same results, it is. Of course, combinations may
be the causative factor.

Q: Certainly grass fed animals have been shown to
have flesh with fewer bacteria which is a strong
indicator of generally healthier cells. Bacteria
don't survive in healthy cells. They eat junk. You
can age meat from grass fed animals, and wild
fish, so there is lots of evidence the flesh is healthier. It's effect as PART of a diet may show
in the future that it is more useful than grain fed
flesh.

A: Your conclusions may be true, however, I do
not correlate the volume of bacteria with health.
I watch people eat and filled with bacteria that
increases their joy of life and health. I have not
had enough experience to determine that
disease is reversed better or prevented better
with grass-fed creatures. I worked long enough
with wild and farmed fish and have concluded
the same as you did regarding wild and farmed
fish. However, the toxic processed substances
fed farmed fish account for the differences. I do
not know that whole organic grain-fed animals
are less healthy than grazed animals. I have
seen the eatwild website and have read her
information, however she has not been an
empirical scientist. I am and I want to know and
not simply take others conclusions based on
particular chemistry. I want empirical evidence.

Also, conclusions about increased sexual activity
being related to grain fed animals cannot be
made. This is also bad science, i.e. trying to
correlate one factor with another. Only holistic
science brings the truth, an overall view of many
factors.

As people eat foods less toxic, which MAY
include grain fed animals – we don't yet know –
they are helping to detoxify endogenous and
exogenous toxins. The overall detoxification of
endogenous toxins will reduce sexual activity,
although not sexual pleasure. Many people are
addicted to sex, and would find a decrease in
sexual activity as they detoxify their nervous
systems of endogenous toxins.

Ellie, you seem to assume that I do not consider
as much as you. I have been in the science of
diet for 33 years. I am very aware that there are
times when decreased sexual vitality results
from detoxification of gonads, liver, adrenals,
spleen, and nervous system. As I stated above, if
repeated shifts back and forth present the same
results, correlated with eating grain fed animals
vs grass fed can be considered and it is good
science, only if empirical evidence agrees. Of
course, combinations may be the causative
factor, but, if the combinations of foods that I
advise cause a shift, I must consider them.

Q: Difference between eating ground beef and
steak?

Yes, if you’re having ground in a supermarket,
they put it through a high pressure grinder 3
times. That homogenizes the fat. That means
that the protein is pressed into the fat and it’s
going to start a decomposition of the meat. That
is an early stage of high meat which means it
will mainly go for detoxification, not rebuilding
the body. Steak will rebuild the body.

Or if you ask them to put it through the grinder
only one time, that will not homogenize it. If you
put it in your food processor, it will never
homogenize it because it will not put it under high pressure. Pâté it. Chicken is the same.
Wild Oats and Whole Foods only do it 2 times
but still it’s too much. You can run it through
the food processor as long as you want. You can
pâté it. But you should eat it quickly because it
oxidizes it and if you wait more than 2 to 13
hours it’s going to cause more detoxification.

If you’re eating cooked meat, it’s good to have an
alkalizing food with it like a vegetable salad.
Because meat, when it’s cooked, starts to putrefy
in the intestines, by the time it gets into the
small intestines it is putrefying and will not
move through the system easily. The body is
still waiting to get enzymes to deal with these
proteins. The fats and lots of liquid peroxide
form; it becomes highly concentrated in acids.
So, veg. salad moves it through.

But on a raw diet you never want to mix those
two because they will neutralize each other and
will not digest either. One’s acid and one’s
alkaline. Each needs its own environment to
digest properly. Don’t worry about an acid/alkaline balance on this diet.

If you’re feeling irritable, urine burning then
you’re probably over acidic. Then it’s a good
idea to eat some fish with your meat. Say you’re
having 4 oz. of red meat, add 1 oz. of fish. That
will balance it. You can eat it as long as you have
that feeling. Chicken will do it also but need
almost equal proportion of meat and chicken.
Fish, because it’s a high concentration of
minerals, works better to balance that acidity.
Ear ringing does not signify over acidity. There
could be five different reasons for tinnitus.

Mixing salad and meat is terrible. Tomato is not
a vegetable nor is cucumber. Too much
cucumber is alkalizing. ½ of a cucumber is too
much. Vegetables are leaves, stalks and root.
Bland foods are not a problem. Onions and
celery for flavoring is fine.

Avocado and beef are okay however, avocados
are difficult to digest. When you eat them with
meat so often what happens is it turns it into
pyruvate. So instead of using your meat for
regenerating tissues and building cells, it will go
to burn as fuel. That is a way to waste your
meat. Eat avocado with a fruit. If you eat it by
itself it won’t digest well. You can have a little of
your meat with it, not a lot. Avocado and fish is the same problem as with meat. You can eat
tomato and avocado. If you have 3 meat meals a
day, one meat meal with avocado (one half) is
fine.

Rosie is all organic and Rocky is not organic.
The Rosie is fed mostly processed, cook soy
beans. I did this for years. I don’t eat it. I went
back to Rocky. It’s fed off of corn and good stuff
not processed like soy. Not organic – they don’t
feed them hormones and they don’t get
antibiotics but the food they feed them wasn’t
necessarily grown without chemicals. Coleman
also. The chemist for Rosie said there was no
GMO soy but by the time you finish processing
soy, it’s worse than chemical anyway. He feels
75 to 80% good. By good he means clarity of
thinking, good digestion and the by products are
not distracting. You’re getting chemicals but
with the clay and juice you offset those things. A
chicken that eats a natural range and you eat that chicken you will feel better. A chicken that
would never naturally eat soy. They don’t have
the enzymes to digest the soy properly so they
have to process the soy or it’s poisonous to the
chicken. Just like a human fed raw soy beans, it
will get sick and die if has very much often. If
you ate a cup of soy for about 3 weeks you’d die.
Unless it’s processed you cannot digest it. If you
ate enough raw soy beans in 2 days you’d have a
severe case of diarrhea and vomiting. I choose a
chicken that eats raw, natural food even though
it’s not organic rather than a chicken that’s been
fed processed soy beans that they would never
eat anyway.

Q: If you eat the Rocky chicken every day, how
much clay should you eat to offset the non organic
stuff fed to the chicken?

A: It depends if you’re drinking your juice. If
you’re drinking your organic juice, then ¼
teaspoon every other day. You can put it in your
juice. If you’re not drinking the juice, you’re
going to need more. If you’re drinking 2 cups of
juice a day, every other day, ¼ teaspoon would
be preventive. If you’re drinking 4 cups of juice
a day, don’t need to worry about it. You can put
the clay into the juice or have it any other time.
Lily’s chicken is hard to get. It’s the best. They
bring them into Santa Monica market. You have to order it ahead of time and you have to buy the
whole chicken.

Q: Lastly, sometimes in restaurants the only raw
alternative is smoked salmon or cured beef or
ham – although all are uncooked, they have a lot
of salt. I have been choosing these items instead of
eating cooked food, but am I doing myself more
harm this way?

A: They will promote disease.

Q: I do have a question. I could not find in your
book info on cured meats; us Italians like to hang
the sausage in the cellar. Are these considered
raw?

A: Cured meat has lost most of its enzymes. It is
best to eat non-dried.

Q: It said on the group, as well ,that you said one
must get most animal fat from dairy and not meat
fat as this can contain toxins. I have not seen any
reference to this in your book. Did you in fact say
this? Can you elaborate please?

A: If an animal is lean, the fat will contain more
toxins. When eaten raw, tests have shown that
the fat passes relatively undigested and binds
the toxins to the feces. We may obtain the
much-needed large amounts of animal fat from
cream and butter.

Mushrooms are the fruit of mycelium; it helps
break down toxic connective tissue. Let’s say
you have capillaries, all kinds of connections
circulating through your system where there is
blood and lymph. You have all these places to
circulate lymph blocked and neurological
information and fluids. If these get jammed and
locked up, the mushrooms produce a substance
that breaks those down readily. That is what
they do in the ground and what they do to roots.
Should we eat mushrooms on a regular basis if
on the raw diet? That all depends. If you want a
heavy detox, then go ahead. If you eat it with the
meat, it will help you digest the meat. It will
help break it down. But if you eat a lot of it, it
will cause a heavy circulatory detoxification
which may not be bad. Shiitake will do it. They
are highly genetically bred.

Q: What about kombucha tea?

It is all garbage – you have to cook it to make it.
It is not a real mushroom.

Mycelium is a white, liquid fungus that eats up
roots that have died. You’ll see white fluid if you
dig up around a dead tree. The roots bind veins
to the large artery type roots. When those
propagate, they put out mushrooms; that is their
spore. If it finds a dead root, it’ll go to work and
that will produce mushrooms. Don’t eat it on
the weight loss. Truffles just happen on the bark
of a tree. It falls off and pigs dig them up. Truffle
oil is all processed. Cream, little honey, blend
half of mushrooms with that and an egg if you
like it really rich then chop the rest of the
mushrooms and fold it in – have that with the
meat. Say take 2 large mushrooms, blend 1,
chop the other.

Q: How much mustard can you eat?

As much as you want. Raw mustard causes
peristalsis. Pasteurized mustard paralyzes
peristalsis (action of the intestines moving foods
through causes juices and bacteria to work on
the food). Pasteurization stops proper
digestion; raw mustard forces it. If you have so
much to have diarrhea then you’re eating too
much. Would that cause bad breath? That’s
from toxic substances leaving through the lungs
and as blood passes through the intestines
releases gases and passes out the mouth. You
have the lubrication with a little bit more lemon
in it will help. Or rinse the mouth out with
lemon juice or have ½ cup lemonade.

Noni has been proved to be remedial for cancer
on a large number Native Hawaiians only when
eaten raw. Noni processed and bottled has
proved to be relatively non-remedial for cancer
and other diseases.

Q: Noni juice?

A: Noni is a very pungent fruit grown in Hawaii
and some other islands. I found it reverses a
great percentage of cancer. When it is juiced it
is pasteurized and does not have the same effect.
It has a lot of sugar and is very toxic and will
incite cancer. Cancer thrives in an area of the
body that has been degenerated and lots of cells
have died mostly because of sugar – advanced
glycation end products. NYC Medical University
proved that in a healthy body they store at a rate
of 70%. In an unhealthy body they store at a rate of 90%. They means every time you eat a
cooked carbohydrate, bread, pasta, etc. about
90% of that or more will store in your body for
your life time. That breaks into an acid that will
melt your tissue like sugar. As people get older,
the tissue and muscle start sagging. Sagging is in
people who have a more difficult time with their
sugar. Noni juice, when pasteurized, creates a
higher amount of those by-products of sugar
when they‘re made into glycogen and utilized as
glycogen.

No, it is very difficult to get any digestibility of
the proteins in nuts because it takes a
vegetarian animal to break the protein down
properly even if you soak. It makes it worse
because then it starts to react into a vegetable
and starts to grow. Once you do that, there are
enzymes that are prohibitive of certain digestive
functions. For instance, if that did not react, all
birds would eat all seeds and there would be
nothing growing. They would not be eating
insects or anything else.

Q: And there are enzymes in sprouts. There are
books out on it now stating that there is an acid
that prevents other foods from being digested.
And you develop an allergy to those sprouts for
that reason.

A: If you are going to eat fruit, I tell everyone to eat it with lots of fat – raw unsalted cheese, raw
unsalted butter, avocado, peanut oil that is
pressed below 96 degrees F, raw cream.

People gain weight with nuts because of the
enzyme inhibitors so they just store up in the
body.

Almonds are very difficult to digest. All nuts
contain enzyme-inhibitors that restrict or
prevent proper protein digestion or utilization.

Q: How does this affect their therapeutic value?

I have experimented with almonds on a wholly
raw diet and have not found any therapeutic
value of raw almonds. Squirrels and birds
probably obtain therapeutic value from
almonds.

Q: How toxic and what symptoms might show?

A; Protein deficiencies such as loss of appetite,
especially for meat, irritability, nausea and
lethargy.

If I crave a starch, I will go for nuts. I will eat
walnuts or pecans because they are very soft
and easier to break down. And I utilize the
starch better. And most people I found can’t.
Almonds are a little more difficult to break down
even if they are germinated because the enzyme
is created. Also pine nuts. Cashews are
irradiated. They have the hardest shell on the
planet. They fire a laser beam into it. Heats it on
the inside and explodes it open. That is why
most people who eat them can’t digest them. It
just sits in the stomach. And they say raw and it
is a lie. Macadamia nuts are great. They may
heat the outside to 100-110 degrees. The inside
usually does not get to over 105 degrees and
that is okay if you can find a local farm. They do
farm them up in Santa Barbara. If you can find
some local people it is even better. Most of
these from Hawaii are put into kilns and dried at about 110 degrees.

Q: I want to say that Hilarion recommends that
you take a Cal/Mg source after your smoothie.

A: Theoretically that is a good idea but most
people do not digest nuts. There is an enzyme
suppressant in all nuts. So the formula I gave
which breaks that down which is 4 oz of nuts
(pecans, walnuts, filberts, pine nuts, sunflower
seeds, pumpkin seeds) any one of those or any
combination of all 6 of them. Blend them to a
powder. Blend 1-2 eggs (2 if you want it richer).
2 Tbsp of honey, 3-4 oz of cream, raw coconut
cream, butter, or the Spectrum peanut oil which
is light yellow in color. Blend that for about 30-
50 seconds and there you will digest just about
everything. That formula took me years to come
up with that. It neutralizes the enzymatic
suppressants in nuts without germinating them.

Once you germinate them, soak them, you turn
them into a vegetable so you do not digest them
very well. You are caught between a rock and a
hard place. When you eat that formula it
neutralizes the enzyme inhibitors in the nuts. If
you germinate nuts like a lot of vegans do and
fruitarians do and a lot of instinctos do it creates
a vegetable molecule, more cellulose which we
can not break down. So we are caught between
a rock and a hard place. It took me about 11
years to create that formula before it would
actually neutralize the enzyme inhibitors ...
walnuts, pecans, filberts, pine nuts, sunflower
seeds and pumpkin seeds.

All nuts have enzyme suppressants in them. If
you eat them by themselves it will prevent you
from digesting proteins. It could also make you
depressed or sluggish – it manifest differently
for each person. That is why I always suggest
you blend them to a powder, mix in an egg or
some kind of fat – cream, peanut oil, coconut
butter, butter – 4 oz of nuts (either pine nuts,
walnuts, pecans halves – any combination) and
3 oz of your given choice of fat, 1 egg, 1-2 tsp of
honey (depending on how sweet you like it) and
blend that. That way the butter and the honey
will convert the enzyme suppressant into an
enzyme active ingredient.

Q: Is there an advantage to taking walnuts and
nuts?

Yes. There are a lot of people who take drugs over the years (aspirin, thyroxin) and that
dumps into the body. The body requires a high
protein starch to absorb it; the little bit that is in
the juices you get will have a little bit but when
your body craves a potato, bread, popcorn –
then you need the nut butter.

Q: What is the purpose of the nut drink?

For most people, it is to chelate with excess
hormones or toxic hormones improperly stored
in the body – any drugs that may have stored in
the body – and are coming out of the system. It
arrests them and the fat binds with that and
usually will get broken down in the lymph and
discarded out the bowels or the skin

As I said, the body discards in any way it can
because we are so toxic – of course we have the
bowel, the skin, the sinuses, they eyes, the ear
ducts, and of course the urinary tract, and of
course women also have the vaginal cavity
which is constantly throwing off mucus – that is
my theory of why women live longer than men –
because they have one more constant discharge
to discharge poisons. Peanut oil seems to work
with the glands a little bit better including
sexual – the Africans use it as an aphrodisiac. If
you have it in your nut mix it will stimulate your
sexuality eventually if you have enough of it. 2xs a week will stimulate that

The olive oil is more scar tissue oriented and
helps dissolve it.

The flax oil (very unstable) is more related to
the intestines and glands

You should always have the oils with other
meats – you can have a solvent in there but if
you do not have a good fat along with it, it will
cause you to be irritable, dry or have flaky skin.
It is better to have it with milk afterwards. I
enjoy the nut mixes with chicken and turkey,
sometimes with meat – not so much with fish.

If you have too much of the nut butter mix it will
affect your taste for meat and fruit will do the
same. It is good to rotate your oils that way the
olive oil will not be concentrated with meat all
the time. If you are having the olive oil only with
the red meat it will constantly go in and clean
out your liver and muscle tissue and heart – and
the heart and muscles need a break, so spread it
out. Fish will be oriented towards nervous
system. With fowl it will be connected with
connective tissue, lymph, organs and
neurological tissues.

I was asked recently, " If we can pulverize the
anti-enzymes out of nuts with a blender, then
why doesn’t chewing do the same thing? "

Pulverizing does not neutralize the enzyme
inhibitors. Pulverizing merely exposes them.
The combination of egg, fat and honey
neutralizes the exposed inhibitors.

Q: My only thought would be that it is not the
pulverizing that inactivates these anti-enzymes
but the fact that the surface area is increased so
that the ingredients mixed with the nuts can
inactivate the anti-enzymes.

A: correct.

Q: If I'm wrong, then it seems chewing should do
the same thing as the blender.

A: I wish.

Q: I am making pemmican from mixing dried
powdered meats and organs with raw bone
marrow or brains. Would any of your clients like
this?

A: We do not eat dried meats unless it is an
emergency. Many vitamins and enzymes are
biologically inactive in dried meat. Like the
American Indians in Canada in the 1800's, they
made pemmican each year in case they did not
find any fresh animal during the winter. Each
year they buried it as waste if they did not have
to eat it.

Q: Why not salt and any other spices?

Salt increases the sodium ions heavily in the
blood and the body eats by the process of ion
attraction. So let’s say that you have a
potassium ion maybe carrying a carbohydrate or
a protein molecule. The cell opens up. Attracts
that ion that is carrying that nutrient and gets to
eat. If it is a sodium ion most of the time it is
carrying water. If you eat salt, whether it is sea
salt, Celtic salt, whatever it might be, it causes
clumping of sodium ions. That creates such a
magnetism outside the cells that often when the
cell opens to get the H 2 0 instead of the
molecules being drawn in they will be ripped
out of the cell and the cell can never eat again. It
shrivels up like a raisin and dies. So I even
learned that in high school from my biology
teacher. And he showed us that a grain of salt can kill 2 million RBC by that clumping no
matter what kind of salt that is.

Q: Someone did a dark field and my blood cells
were all clumping together. And I had no idea
what that was about. I also had a feeling that this
guy was generating an electrical field and that
would clump cells that way.

A: That would happen too but there are many
things that would cause cells to clump,
thousands. It depends on what you ate, hours or
days before. And even what electrical fields you
have gotten into. Those blood cell analysis’s
change every moment. How can you base
anything on something that is changeable within
moments?

Q: I started using salt, especially on avocado,
recently. I am pretty much a 100% raw eater and
this is a recent lazy change. How bad is that? I
know it is not part of your recommended diet. I
used lots of salt for the first 63 years of my life. It
was quite a bit an addiction. I had chronic high
BP [blood pressure] before I got on your diet.

A: Salt destroys many cells, causes cells to
dehydrate and concentrations of H 2 O in blood
serum that cannot be utilized properly and
causes bloating in many people. Using salt once
every six months or once a year may be
remedial, but continuously causes diseases.

Q: Hi, I realize you don't know me but please at
your convenience go to
http://www.pulseparty.com/117734. When you get in go
to whole foods. please look at Sol Saltz and Pulse and Parched Pulse. The Pulse is raw because the
temp is not above 93.

I know salt is not good for us but I have been told
it is what is in the salt that we buy and not the
salt itself. This is supposed to be pure salt. I just
ate some raw London broil and a tiny bit of salt
would have been great on it. The Pulse is great
(especially the carob) with heavy cream.

A: Any salt concentrates sodium, causing extra
and intercellular edema and leeching of blood
and tissue nutrients. My recipe book gives 87
sauce recipes for meat that can be made in 3-5
ways, equaling about 400 sauces.

Sea vegetable varieties are complicated to digest
in whole form. They seem to hold up to
digestive juices more rigidly than land
vegetables. They contain many wonderful
nutrients that would promote human health if
they could be extracted in digestion. Therefore,
occasionally juicing them is preferable, however,
the taste is repulsive for many people.

Q: On the live food group it says that you are
quoted as saying you drink a spirulina and some
other algae mix a few times per week. Is this the
algae water you referred to in our consultation or
is it recommended to take powdered spirulina as
sold in health food stores?

A: They failed to list that I had continual and
repeated skin irritation, inflammation and
itching as a result of drinking it.

The tea is dead and causes over-acidity; it will
disturb digestive juices. The green drink IS your
tea, live and active with enzymes and nutrients.
To create the experience of tea, place the green
drink in a jar and immerse it in hot water – not
too hot! – and drink it warm.

Q: Over the same time period, the pipes/plumbing
in my house have been root-clogged (a common
problem); backing up and overflowing several
times into my side yard where I now have some
very healthy tomato plants!! Should one eat the
tomatoes "of one's own making"?

A: If you eat only raw food, your waste-products
are excellent compost. If not, the waste contains
mutagenic bacteria produced by heterocyclic
amines and other poisons that do not promote
well-being of the consumer.

Q: You advise not to put oil on vegetables; does
that mean leafy greens only?

A: All vegetables, leaves, stalks and roots are
rendered more difficult to digest when eaten
with oils.

Q: Can I have oils with vegetable juices?

A: Cold-pressed below 96 degrees F. vegetable
oils do not un healthfully interfere with the
digestion of vegetable juices. They may be
consumed with or in vegetable juices.

Q: Can coconut oil or avocado be eaten with
vegetables?

A: Coconut cream obtained from juicing coconut
meat, as I recommended in my book, and avocado may be eaten with vegetables.

Note: Although one or two companies claim that
their coconut oils are raw, they are heated and I
do not recommend eating them [except for
[http://www.thaiorganiclife.com/product/virgin-coconut-](http://www.thaiorganiclife.com/product/virgin-coconut-oil-pure-raw/ .]

Note to questions 4 and 5: The problem with
eating whole vegetables on a raw diet is that it
often causes constipation. Vegetables never
properly digest because humans don’t have
digestive tracts like herbivores. Vegetables
secrete alkaline fluids throughout digestion,
including in the bowels, neutralizing bacteria
and digestive juices that are necessary for
proper digestion of protein and fats. People
who eat cooked foods will benefit from eating
vegetables because cooked food is always too
acidic and whole vegetables help neutralize
some of the over acidity in the digestive tract.
Raw vegetables help promote bowel movement
in people eating cooked foods, however, raw
vegetables often cause constipation in people
eating a completely raw diet after being on a
raw diet for approximately 3-6 months.

Q: My question is, given, say, half pound of raw
egg versus raw meat, does that mean that I need
to exclude vegetables (e.g. sprouts) from half-pound of meat but not half-pound of eggs?

A: In general, whole vegetables should be
excluded. Vegetable juices are wonderful but
should be excluded from drinking with meat
and/or eggs; one hour should pass before and
after drinking vegetable juices. Eating them
together usually makes both the juice and the
meat or eggs indigestible, which may result in
lethargy - tiredness. Vegetable juices can be
consumed with fats only, such as, avocado, raw
cream, coconut cream, olive oil, flax oil.
However, drinking too much olive oil or flax oil
with vegetable juices may cause loose stools or
diarrhea.

Q: While some nutritionists claim that vegetables
are more healthful raw than cooked, research
shows that that may not be true. A European
study found that your body absorbs as much as
five times the amount of disease-fighting
antioxidants when you eat vegetables that have
been cooked and mashed as opposed to eaten
raw. Why? Researchers believe that cooking and
mashing the vegetable breaks down the plant cell
walls that contain the antioxidant vitamins,
making them easier to absorb. You can get the
disease-fighting benefits by steaming vegetables
in a pot or in the micro-wave and then tossing
them into a food processor to make a healthy and
hearty vegetable soup.

A: This study did not consider that the bounty of
antioxidants found available were
predominantly inactive, nor the fact that the
steaming created resinous matter that
crystallizes in the body over many years causing
and/or contributing to conditions such as
Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, nor the fact that
steaming creates more oxidants.

Q: What are the benefits of drinking the green
juice?

To keep you from getting dehydrated for one.
There is a lot of sodium in it. It alkalizes the
blood so you can eat the meat. If you can’t, you
will get so acidic that you will be repulsed by all
meats, especially red meat. You can eat fish to
help that. Fish is still acid but there is a high
mineral balance and it will help neutralize... The
high mineral balance in the fish when you are
eating it with the red meat helps neutralize
some of the ill acidity that might be created
when the blood is over acid. But it takes the
juice to alkalize the blood so you continue to
have an appetite. The green juice has so many
reasons, so many functions. The green juice, for
one, has lots of vitamins, enzymes and minerals.
It is basically your supplement. The only bioactive supplement. When you take 2-3 cups a
day that is enough to take care of all the
vitamins, enzymes and minerals that have
deteriorated from the food not being right off
the ground and right out of the butcher block.
That will replace all the enzymes missing
because your food is not as fresh. 1-2 extra cups
a day will help revitalize and replenish and
restore those leached from every time you have
eaten cooked foods in your lifetime. Your
pancreas has to send out hormones to every cell
of the body and say give up what you have
because we have to rob Peter to pay Paul. So
basically your body is leaching from itself and is
getting weaker and weaker every day by every
time you have a cooked meal. So eating extra
vegetable juice helps restore some of that
leached out through the years. And it takes
many cups of juice everyday to restore. I am still
doing it and I am going on 24 years on raw meat
and almost 18 years of eating raw meat on a
daily basis. And I still have to have the juice. I
may be a little different because I had all the
chemo and radiation so that may be a problem
that causes me to need it even more but I think
most people will need it through the 40 year
process. At the end of that time it may be like
any dog or cat. You go out and chew on few
blades of grass and that is all the alkalinity that
you need. That is it. But right now you need a lot.

Any vegetable is best juiced. Cilantro can get rid
of aluminum, mercury, and radioactive minerals
but never do a lot of those herbs because it will
put you into a heavy detox.

Celery, parsley... you can have a lot of those and
it will never cause any extreme effect.

Q: With the vegetable juice, do you have a
particular combination or is it different for each
person?

A: With each person I give a different formula.
But my main advice is that people drink 80%
celery, 20% parsley. This is my general
suggestion.

Q: Should I have any fat with my 4 vegetable
juice drinks?

No, unless you want to increase detoxification
(raw cream, raw coconut cream, cold-pressed
olive, flax or peanut oil), and/or try to force a
bowel movement (cold-pressed olive, flax or
peanut oil).

A: ... White cabbage juice. 8 oz a day. Is it lot of
flow or is it spotting?

Q: It is a little more than spotting.

A: Then I would do 4 oz twice a day.

Q: How can I get it down? It is so disgusting.

A: If you put anything with it, honey, lemon
juice, lime juice it will cause it to do something
else. It has to be by itself. I suggest you just
chug it. Put a clip on your nose and just chug it.

Q: Couldn’t she mix it with 4 oz of the other juice?

A: To stop the bleeding right away, I like the
cabbage juice to be alone. When it is just
internal seepage and I see it in the irises, it can
be mixed with other juice. It will help the
clotting, if you have radiation in your body, birth
control residues in there causing hemorrhaging
all the time or if you have some chemical in
there. Those toxins cause a lack of vitamin K
and vitamin U in the body so you are going to
bleed. So you need that cabbage juice as part of
the healing process even though it is not part of
the direct cause.

Q: How much do you suggest?

A: Half a cup twice a day, morning and night.

Q: Can it be fermented?

A: No. When it is fermented it makes the vitamin
K and vitamin U inactive for what you want it to
do, which is to stop the bleeding. It is light green
but they call it white cabbage.

Q: Cabbage juice?

A: It helps blood clot and helps wounds heal,
including ulcers and psoriasis.

Q: Kale juice?

A: I have not used it remedially because I could
not find any resource for use, except to reverse
scurvy and acne. In at least one book I
discovered that it was the only vegetable that
was high in Vitamin A and Vitamin C,
extraordinarily high. When I do experiment
with it in the future, I would initiate my use of it
in cases of infection, virus, ulceration (with
cabbage), and acne.

Herbs are medicinal and should constitute no
more than 5% of your juice and no more than 2
ounces per day unless suffering severe illness.

Q: Can I juice apples & bland fruits with my
morning green juice?

A: Apple juice and any fruit is not recommended.
Fruit juices cause fatigue because little (5%) is
needed in the citric-acid cycle of strength and
energy production (for activity), and for solvent
production (for dissolving and eliminating
toxins). If the ratio increases beyond 5%, the
body will either make the excess sugar into
glycogen or it will seek and leech fats and
proteins from the body's own constitution, most
likely from glands and nerves, depleting them of
protection, resilience and strength. Since most
bodies are inundated with carbohydrates on
most diets, too much glycogen is often the case.

Therefore, too much fruit, especially in the form
of juice, causes leeching and depletion of glands,
nerves and other tissue. The most fuel-efficient
ratio is: fat = 80%, protein = 15%,
carbohydrates = 5%. The same ratios are most
often optimal for solvent-production.

Q: Can I mix apple cider vinegar and clay and flax
seed oil and royal jelly into my green drink?

A: Vinegar in juice will defeat the purpose of
alkalizing the blood; flax oil in juice will cause
the juice to be too detoxifying to tissues and less
blood-alkalizing; royal jelly in juice is a waste
because royal jelly is effective in helping human
growth hormone production mainly when eaten
with meat.

Q: How do you preserve vegetable juice?

A: The way I preserve vegetable juice –
everybody knows the canning jars. 12 8 oz jars.
I will juice 3 quarts at time and that will last me
3 days. After I juice, I will take one of those 4 oz
jelly jars and put 2 oz juice in it. I will bring the
level of honey to above the first rim so I’ve got 2
½ to 3 oz of honey in it. I screw the blender
blades on that and blend it for 5 seconds so you
do not oxidize while blending the honey into the
whole 3 quarts. You are just going to oxidize
that 2 oz of juice and it is not going to oxidize
that much because it is going to be coated with
honey instantly. So you only blend it for 5
seconds. I pour that around into the other 3 quarts. Stir it around just a little bit so it mixes
in it. Then I will put one quart in a jar so I do not
have my refrigerator overflowing with jars. So
one quart goes into a quart jar. Fill it all the way
to the top. Just slightly to the top. The lids are
recessed so you need just a little space to get the
lid on without spilling over. You put the lid on
to keep the juice from oxidizing. That is the last
quart that I eat. The others I put into the 8 oz
jelly jars almost all the way to the top. They say
they hold 8 oz but they actually hold 9 oz so you
are going to be a little off. That last one is going
to equal 7 ½ jars. Then I have that last one as
the ½ cup. So now when I pull that juice out it
does not oxidize. As along as it stays
refrigerated for 78 hours it will only lose 7-8 %.
Any juice that you buy from a health food store
in a plastic container has lost 30 – 40 % of its
value by the time it hits the shelf because of the
porousness and the content of the plastic puts in
acids that destroy the juice. So if you keep it in
the glass jars without any air in it for 78 hours it
is going to keep with only 7-8 % deterioration in
it.

Q: Can you put a little lemon in it?

A: What I do to help the flavor sometimes is I put
some nasty herbs in it. I will put a little bit of the
rind, 1/3 of a lime for 3 whole quarts. If it is the

weight loss program I will use a lime or a lemon
for the whole 3 quarts. It helps to lose weight. If
you want to just put 1/3 of a lemon or a lime in
while you are juicing your other vegetables and
that will give it a little more tang. Also the oils in
it with the high vitamin C will act as an
antioxidant. Probably it will not even have 7-8%
deterioration but I have not done that test.

Q: When you cannot always get organic, what
about the washes and the peroxides or Clorox that
is used to wash them?

A: All of those things have chemicals. Someone
is selling you on killing things. You want to get
rid of the chemicals – you do not want to put
more chemicals on them. To get rid of the
chemicals on your vegetables that you may not
want on them, just use water and a little vinegar
or water and a little lemon and lime juice.

Q: You do not want us to use a Reverse Osmosis
filter do you?

A: If you are just using it to wash vegetables that
is fine. Because then you want thirsty hungry
water that is going to pull those metals. How
long do you leave it in that solution? 3-5
minutes.

Q: What about that wheat germ that they had at
the Expo? It is not pressed. They sell it in
packages?

A: Wheat germ is a hull. It takes a vegetarian
animal or bird to digest it properly. You will get
very little from it. It is very sensitive to oxygen.

Q: In your book you specifically eliminate
wheatgrass juice as being the only juice that does
NOT neutralize acidity and volatile toxins. If that
is the case, how come so many people seem to
benefit from its "cleansing" properties? Do you
think it is harmful?

A: It may be helpful to people who do not eat
very much raw food. It does supply vitamins,
enzymes and minerals. The problem I have with
it is that it causes more blood-acidity.
Symptoms are varied.

... Well I have been experimenting with wheat
grass juice because of Owanza and other people
who have been using GH [Growth Hormone].
Now a lot of people are using HGH [Human
Growth Hormone] that is extracted from plants,
grasses. And they were claiming incredible
results. However, the people that I tested them
with, the people it would help the most – with
M.S. [Multiple Sclerosis], M.D.[Muscular
Dystrophy], chronic fatigue – reacted so badly
that there was something wrong with them.
From the HGH. So I decided that in order to get
some for people as an alternative, I was going to
have to try to invent something. So I was
looking at the wheat grass because it grows so
quickly. They use the wheat grass because it
grows so rapidly and has HGH. So what I did
was stabilize it in milk. So if you add 3 oz of wheat grass to 29 oz of milk you will get a good
proportion and that helps GH stimulation. I
have only been working with it for a year now
but it seems to be working pretty well. What
you do is take a bottle of milk, drink 3 oz of it
and then put 3 oz of wheat grass in it. Then
shake it up and drink it over a day. The milk
stabilizes the GH properties.

Q: With cancer would you want GH?

A: Well I have only been using it with one cancer
client for fear of that.

Q: Do you drink a quart in a day?

A: I drink it over a day.

Q: Usually what they say is to take GH twice a day
so this you do when ever?

A: I would do it maybe 2-3 times a week.

Q: There is not any limit on the amount of milk
you can have with wheat grass is there?

Well, I have not done any tests on that. My lab
technician died a year ago. So I am not going to
spend another million dollars on research for
something like that. So I am just using it by
exploration and experience. And I use myself
mainly. When this HGH stuff started coming out
people were paying $125 for a month’s supply.
It seems to have helped a few people. I tried it
on 3 different cases that I knew could use the
help. All of them had severe, almost deadly
reactions to it. So I said okay if this can really
help certain conditions and I can find it in a form
that is in food and I can create a formula to do
that then I can utilize it as a tool as well.

So I started looking at where they were getting the growth hormone and they were getting it
from grasses because it grows so fast. Then they
would isolate them and separate them. Even if
they did it at low temperatures, once the
isolation took place it became toxic to people
and worked for some reason on a few people. So
I took the wheat grass juice and asked what is
the best complete food that I can mix it with that
will keep it active and fresh for a longer period
of time and not neutralize its activity. The only
thing that I could come up with, and I tested it
and it worked, was raw milk.

So I started using 1 oz per quart of wheat grass
juice. And have the milk right away, the next
day, the next night and then it still was okay. I
could tell that the life in the wheat grass juice
did not lose its tang or its vitality. And after 3-4
days it started to change a little bit which is the
time I usually have milk consumed anyway.
Then I tried 2 oz and that seemed very
comfortable. I tried it with the 4 oz and it is
really strong. It seems a little overbearing but I
do not know that anything is wrong with it. So
maybe I can let you know at the next pot luck
after trying it again and letting it sit for a little
while.

Q: What long-term effect is expected from it?

A: Just more rapid regeneration of cells.

Q: Then what do you recommend right now?

A: 2 oz per 1 quart of milk.

Q: Have that daily?

A: Well for my body, my system, that is maybe
once a week. But having 4 oz at a time several
times a day will be over a 3 day period.

Q: Regarding wheat grass, I lived with Ann
Wigmore for years and what I learned is that
wheat grass is really a detoxifier. It is not
regenerating. You can only use that much for
regeneration because detoxification does not go
away. Like I used 32 oz of wheat grass a day to
get rid of colon cancer and it did it and I have
seen it used that way. But they did not
regenerate. They were like living skeletons. They
were not human being.

A: That is why I say vegetable juice by itself is all
detoxification. That is why it neutralizes acidity
in the blood and gives you lots of enzymes and
minerals. And that is for supplementation for all
those years of eating cooked foods with no life in
it. This is to replace it. That is why I put the
wheat grass juice – with GH in it – in milk so it could alter it and if there was a possibility of
using those GH in the human body to regenerate
cells, you would do it in that substance.

Q: Is that as a preventive measure?

A: No, it is an increase of stability.

Q: I have a question about the wheat grass. If
they put the honey in that as well or will that
throw it off if you mix the juice the milk and the
wheat grass?

A: Because of the oxygenation it could cause a
little problem; it might help the digestion if you
are already using a tbsp per quart before you
put the wheat grass in. He asked if putting
honey with the wheat grass juice and milk
formula work against the regenerative powers
of the mixture. I would probably say no as long
as it was a smaller amount. As long as you
blended the milk with the honey previous to
putting the wheat grass in, it would probably be
fine.
